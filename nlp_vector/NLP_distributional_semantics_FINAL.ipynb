    "# NLP Project: Vector Space Semantics for Similarity between Eastenders Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will be creating a vector representation of a document containing lines spoken by a character in the Eastenders script data (i.e. from the file `training.csv`), then improving that representation such that each character vector is maximially distinguished from the other character documents. This distinction is measured by how well a simple information retrieval classification method can select documents from validation and test data as belonging to the correct class of document (i.e. deciding which character spoke the lines by measuring the similarity of those document vectors to those built in training).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the lines are not evenly distributed in terms of frequency, this project stipulates that only a maximum of the first **400 lines** of each character in the training data is allowed to create the training documents, and a maximum of the first **40 lines** in the test data (from `test.csv`). This makes it more challenging, as number of lines spoken by a character can't be used directly or otherwise as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will improve the character vector representations by pre-processing, feature extraction and transformation techniques."

And you really wouldn\\'t have got this far without her. _EOL_ Sorry. No sorry don\\'t cut it. _EOL_ I mean I know she\\'s on the porky side and doesn\\'t exactly look like Julia _EOL_ ...But she\\'s been a good mate to you and this is how you repay her. _EOL_ You\\'re gonna feel a damn site worse by the time I\\'ve finished with you. I always said you were a stuck up... _EOL_ Don\\'t just stand there. get some water or something. _EOL_ What are you doing? _EOL_ Why are you being so nice to her? She dumped you as her bridesmaid this morning. Or have you forgotten that already? _EOL_ Come on, we\\'ve done our bit. Brought her home. Go and get Minty, he can do the rest. She ain\\'t your responsibility. _EOL_ Fine. You stay here and play Florence Nightingale if you like, I\\'m going down the pub. There\\'s no helping some people. _EOL_ I wanted to stay. Make sure you were alright. _EOL_ Easy Hev. You\\'ll be done for indecent assault. _EOL_ Yeah well before you ask. He ain\\'t stopping here. _EOL_ It\\'s not my problem. _EOL_ She\\'s probably shacked up with some other mug by now. It\\'s history. _EOL_ You gotta find her first. _EOL_ Thought we\\'d got rid of you. _EOL_ Well don\\'t plan on stopping long. I like my home to be a man free zone unless I\\'ve got use for him.

It\\'s just temporary. Dean ain\\'t gonna want to live with his Mum for long either but while he does, I wanna be there for him. _EOL_ Oh you know why Hev. This is my second chance. To be the Mum he\\'s always wanted me to be. And he\\'s gonna need me even more now Kevin\\'s gone. _EOL_ No. You\\'re gold, you are. Thanks Hev. I knew you\\'d understand. Come on, I\\'ll help you pack. _EOL_ You got two spare rooms, why not? It doesn\\'t make sense. How are you two going to win this wedding competition if don\\'t even look like a couple? _EOL_ You tell the magazine people? _EOL_ As far as they\\'re still concerned, she\\'s still Hazel. _EOL_ Don\\'t you wanna find out why she did it first? Tell him. And listen this time cos she was trying to help you. _EOL_ Hazel told Garry to make her look like the villain so you didn\\'t have to blame yourself. That means she still cares about you Minty. _EOL_ That\\'s why Heather carried on with this competition. She knows there\\'s still something between you two. _EOL_ That\\'s your first port of call - make things right. Go and find him and ask him if he knows how she feels and if he can find her again. Cos if he don\\'t know... _EOL_ Then go and make things better before it\\'s too late. _EOL_ I told ya I\\'d find ya a place to stay. _EOL_ Yeah, but he\\'s left you here though ain\\'t he? that\\'s squatters rights at least. _EOL_ Just unpack your bags and stop worrying. Look I\\'ve gotta dash. Dean\\'s coming out at midday. Aren\\'t you gonna wish me luck? _EOL_ I can\\'t wait to see him Hev. _EOL_ Hev? You come back for something? Dean?

That\\'s riches enough. _EOL_ That was different. That was then and this is now. _EOL_ Both of us. I said I\\'d look after you didn\\'t I? Put you up, give you money, whatever you want. _EOL_ Look I\\'ve been saving Dean. I told you that. Half of my wages, every week, it\\'s yours, do what you want with it. Welcome home. I just wanted to hold you. I won\\'t push it. _EOL_ You look different Dean. Older. _EOL_ You\\'ve brought a tart back here? _EOL_ How much? _EOL_ I\\'ll see you later then. _EOL_ You go near him I\\'ll kill you. _EOL_ At Minty\\'s flat. And she\\'ll do it like a shot. If you let her stay there, of course. _EOL_ Hev, it\\'s me. Listen, Garry and Minty are coming over, but it don\\'t matter what they say, stick to your guns, here\\'s the deal. _EOL_ Peggy? Have you got that beer? _EOL_ Let\\'s go over there shall we, out the way - sorry Peggy. _EOL_ Do you want sit here quietly, or do you want to go home? _EOL_ Here\\'s to you. _EOL_ I will I will. Just make sure Sean don\\'t follow. _EOL_ Dean. What the hell are you doing? Where are you going? _EOL_ No look, come back to the flat. I\\'ll fix you up, I\\'ll do you something to eat. Whatever you want. _EOL_ I was trying to make things better. _EOL_ Yeah I am. _EOL_ No I\\'ve changed. I can help you. _EOL_ Here. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Yeah. Still. _EOL_ Someone after you? Who is it? Some bloke - who didn\\'t want to hear the answer no? _EOL_ Don\\'t worry. _EOL_ Oh, you\\'re singing my song, mate. But it\\'s only cos we have to, eh? Let me buy you a coffee. _EOL_ Two coffees please Emin. _EOL_ Worst yet. You? Been clubbing? Was it good? _EOL_ Why was that? _EOL_ That\\'s great, that\\'s, that\\'s... just how I feel. _EOL_ How about you, Emin? Bet you\\'re a good boy. Bet you\\'re a good boy to your Mum. Respectful. I bet if I was your Mum, you\\'d love me whatever, wouldn\\'t ya? How about we make these an Irish... Oh. _EOL_ Me too. More than. _EOL_ Oh Is that him? _EOL_ Oi, come here. This is your lucky night.

It\\'s this way. _EOL_ He\\'s gone. _EOL_ When I\\'m dead probably. And even then just to make sure. _EOL_ Don\\'t flatter yourself. It\\'s because of me this time. _EOL_ Like I\\'d notice with this hangover. You\\'d be doing me a favour, go ahead. _EOL_ If he gets in contact I\\'ll pass it on. Now if you can excuse me, I think I\\'m gonna puke. _EOL_ Oh look just keep them coming and save the chat for punters alright. _EOL_ Yeah well it was a double vodka. In case you\\'d forgotten. _EOL_ Don\\'t worry. He won\\'t be coming in here again. _EOL_ Yeah, well if it don\\'t happen in your pub, you haven\\'t got a problem have ya? Cheers Ronnie. Stick it on my tab. _EOL_ If I look as rough as you, then yeah, I better had. _EOL_ I\\'m not doing the shift. _EOL_ I lost my son. _EOL_ I got you. Have I? I don\\'t know anymore. _EOL_ Why are you here, Phil? Why do yo wanna help me? _EOL_ Thanks. _EOL_ I think you might\\'ve got the wrong idea. It was a gropathon, weren\\'t it Charlie? _EOL_ You ain\\'t seen it then. _EOL_ In your dreams. You\\'re her competition. _EOL_ Don\\'t do that. You\\'ll make it worse. _EOL_ You told them? Are you mental? _EOL_ You could have at least tried to come up with something else. _EOL_ Just face the facts. _EOL_ Now hang on a minuite Minty. It only takes one person to ring up that magazine to say that this is not Hazel Hobbs. It\\'s Heather Trott. With somebody elses bloke. And it\\'s sayanora twenty grand. _EOL_ Oh who was the one talking about never giving up? You. Come with me. _EOL_ Right you lot. At twoo\\'clock Heather\\'s gonna make an announcement. So spread the word. She\\'ll even throw in some crisps on the house. _EOL_ Where\\'s Peggy? _EOL_ I\\'ll start my shift early. _EOL_ I thought Minty was your mate. I\\'m doing this favour so they can stay in the competition. _EOL_ It\\'s time to make the announcement. _EOL_ Stop shoving crisps in it. _EOL_ Just get on with it. _EOL_ Put a sock in it will yeah! Heather\\'s trying to make an announcement. _EOL_ For crying out loud. It\\'s like this. They gonna get married and win this competition and get twenty thousand pound. Then Minty goes to find Hazel. Heather goes and has some plastic surgery,and then they all live happily ever after. Only not together. So if anybody from the magazine starts snooping about, you just play along. _EOL_ No. I\\'m still waiting for him to make an honest woman out of me. _EOL_ That\\'s alright. You\\'ll be surprised at the assumptions some people make about me. _EOL_ Phil. _EOL_ Bright? Blimey. Where\\'s he get that from? Cos it\\'s not from you. _EOL_ Does your dad know you\\'ve come home for lunch? _EOL_ You okay Ben? _EOL_ Well it does if you walk about with a face like that. So? _EOL_ Well your dad will. _EOL_ Meaning, you want me to help you? What time do you need me? _EOL_ You\\'re on. And I tell you what, me and you, we\\'re gonna put them other kids to shame! _EOL_ Ooohs there\\'s an offer a girl don\\'t hear every day. _EOL_ Filling in for you. Helping Ben. _EOL_ How the hell should I know? _EOL_ Well I just didn\\'t think cupid would turn up wearing specs and an hearing-aid. _EOL_ He\\'s asked us both here, and locked us in. Work it out, Phil, it\\'s a set-up. _EOL_ We\\'re here now... _EOL_ What? _EOL_ No, I can\\'t. I\\'ve got to go. _EOL_ I turn up for work and you leave me waiting outside. _EOL_ I\\'m here ain\\'t I? _EOL_ Bottling and cleaning yeah? _EOL_ Said the alcoholic. Look I\\'ve got a cold, I took some tablets, they\\'ve kicked in. I\\'m fine. See? Like a rock. Like a great big rock. _EOL_ Oh no. _EOL_ I thought I\\'d take up juggling.

Go on lock the doors, you know what to do. _EOL_ Well I\\'m hardly drunk am I? _EOL_ Get your hands off me. _EOL_ I could have you for harassment. _EOL_ I don\\'t need sorting out. You? You\\'re the one that needs sorting out. _EOL_ What are you sacking me? _EOL_ I don\\'t need sorting out. I don\\'t need anything. _EOL_ What the \\'ell are you doing? _EOL_ So you thought you\\'d chuck a load of water over me. _EOL_ How did you get in? _EOL_ I\\'m soaked. _EOL_ Your head in a minute. What the... _EOL_ D\\'you really want me to tell you? _EOL_ No way. _EOL_ ',\n",
       " 'OTHER': \"Shirl... _EOL_ Where you going? _EOL_ In my right pocket. _EOL_ I'm done for. _EOL_ I'm done for. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Don't go Shirl. I'm not going to make it. _EOL_ No I ain't got five minutes. I, I ain't got it. You just, you just sit there with me please. I don't want to go on my own. _EOL_ Please, Shirley, for once in your life do what I ask. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm so scared. _EOL_ Phil said he'd be alright. He's only having a shandy. _EOL_ I've had two and my legs feel funny. _EOL_ Don't be daft. That's in your head. There's hardly anything in it. That's one of them looks, innit? What have I done wrong? _EOL_ Come on then, what is it? _EOL_ What have I gotta do, run a load of options through my head? _EOL_ Oh come on, I thought you'd be working. _EOL_ I'm lost here. Do you know what she's on about? _EOL_ Roxy? _EOL_ You are such a plank? _EOL_ What? What did I do? _EOL_ Get us another pint and I'll tell you your schoolboy mistakes. _EOL_ Is there room for me? _EOL_ Yeah, course there is darling. _EOL_ I'll get you a drink. _EOL_ Come and sit with us. _EOL_ You don't think Shirley's gone home, do you? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ What are you on about? You've been acting weird all day. _EOL_ Know what? _EOL_ Well I'm so glad that you approve. I'm looking forward to an enchanting evening. Won't you park your backside down there? _EOL_ He's at work obviously. He has to pay the rent. He don't live juice free life like you do. _EOL_ Well er... Sort of. And seeing as we're both at a loose end. Rushing off so soon? I've got a swiss roll with your name on it. _EOL_ Are you alright? _EOL_ I might call it a night. _EOL_ Eh, Shab, you what? We've only been here a couple of hours. It's not midnight for ages. _EOL_ I think I should spend it with my family. _EOL_ Oh great, this is her her Mum giving her the guilt trip. It's not right Shab. _EOL_ Night. _EOL_ Gal, can you do us a favour? _EOL_ Yeah course. _EOL_ It's just that guy over there's been giving me the eye all night. So can you go and stand over there, cause I don't want him getting the wrong idea do I? _EOL_ You can do better than that. _EOL_ Garry. _EOL_ Look it's me. Um, yeah, they told me. _EOL_ Why were you in the car with him? _EOL_ He asked you to go with him to get a window changed? _EOL_ Oh. Was there something going on? _EOL_ No I mean, was he up to something? Something dodgy? _EOL_ Why didn't you just get a bit of cardboard over it and forget it? _EOL_ Yeah. So, er, what _EOL_ I'm asking you. _EOL_ I really don't want to be a widow but I am. _EOL_ How could the bonnet just fly up? _EOL_ Then what? Eh? Was it quick? Did he go quick? _EOL_ Just tell me. _EOL_ Did he say anything? _EOL_ What did you do? _EOL_ Did he say anything? _EOL_ Are you lying to me? Are you just- _EOL_ Right ok, then. That was it? Those were his last words? _EOL_ What, what did he look like? Did he, did he look scared? _EOL_ And did he do anything else? _EOL_ He what? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Have you told Carly? _EOL_ Oh, do you know where she is? _EOL_ I'll wait til she comes in and I'll, yeah, I'll sit them all down. _EOL_ Ere, I was thinking, right, me and you shoudl make a deal. You know, come midnight, if neither of us have pulled, eh? What do you reckon? Feel free to think about it. _EOL_ Oi, oi. Excuse me, I was talking to him actually. _EOL_ I wanted to stay til midnight. _EOL_ Me too. Ben's Dad was going to let off fireworks. _EOL_ You've changed your mind like a yo-yo today Mum. _EOL_ I hate new year. Every year it's the same. And dunno why we put ourselves through it? Next year, someone's gonna have to stop me. What are you all just sitting here for? Mmm? _EOL_ Sit down, darling. I've um, I've got something I have to tell you. A few hours ago ... Kevin had an accident. _EOL_ And the ambulance got to him as quick as he could. And they...they did everything they could. They tried ... they tried. But he... He died. _EOL_ No. He couldn't have. But I don't believe it. Mum.... _EOL_ He's not dead. _EOL_ It's not true. _EOL_ It is. The police told me. _EOL_ I want to see him. Where is he? Where is he? _EOL_ He's at the hospital darling you can't. _EOL_ I want to see him. I want to see my Dad. _EOL_ There's a fight! Fight!DAWN/ _EOL_ What is your problem? _EOL_ Just calm yourself down. _EOL_ Mrs Wicks... _EOL_ Up you get. Go on. Get up. Go on. Please. You said that you was gonna be there to kiss me at midnight. Giving one to Shirley to pass on to me. Nah. That don't count. _EOL_ Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! _EOL_ Happy new year, my darling. _EOL_ Denise asleep? _EOL_ Pills seem to be working. _EOL_ Best if she's, you know... _EOL_ Unconscious? _EOL_ Resting. _EOL_ In case you change your mind. _EOL_ Okay? _EOL_ Yes. No. I don't know. I feel like I should be...doing something. Helping. _EOL_ Like what? _EOL_ There must be stuff to do. Arrange the funeral. Get the undertakers. _EOL_ You can't. _EOL_ At least I'll be doing something instead of just sitting around feeling like-- _EOL_ It's New Year's Day. _EOL_ I forgot. _EOL_ Tomorrow, love. There'll be plenty to do tomorrow. _EOL_ And today? I'll see you later. _EOL_ Where're you going? _EOL_ I dunno. Around. I just have to, you know... _EOL_ There is something you can do. Someone needs to tell Deano. _EOL_ Mum! Oscar's crying. MUM! He wants you. _EOL_ Give it here. _EOL_ Get off. _EOL_ Lucy keeps changing the channel. _EOL_ ‚Cos it's boring. _EOL_ Why don't you set the oven timer, we can find out. _EOL_ Lazy Town? _EOL_ Denise Wicks? _EOL_ She's asleep, I'm afraid. _EOL_ There are a few things we need to clear up regarding Mr Wicks's death. A few questions. _EOL_ Can I help? _EOL_ It's okay. I'll take care of it. _EOL_ Having a bit of a chuck-out. New Year, and everything. _EOL_ Bradley... _EOL_ I had no idea I had so many versions of Thunderball. Not that you can have too many, eh? _EOL_ You are all right, aren't you, dear? _EOL_ Of course. _EOL_ Something like this...you want to talk. There's only one person you want to talk to...but...you can't. It's understandable that you get frustrated and ever so- _EOL_ I said I'm okay. _EOL_ -angry. _EOL_ I'm fine. Really. _EOL_ You have to try and put it behind you. _EOL_ Did you know, the last note is so high, Tom Jones passed out at the end of recording this? _EOL_ See, the thing is, we've checked the person the vehicle was registered to. And they don't exist. _EOL_ But that-- _EOL_ Makes the car Mr Wicks was driving suddenly very interesting. _EOL_ You think it was stolen. _EOL_ I didn't say that. Sell many of them, did he? _EOL_ Stolen cars? No. _EOL_ Bet he got offered them now and again. _EOL_ And he'd've said no. He wasn't into any of that. _EOL_ Never touched a dodgy motor? _EOL_ They're not all Arthur Daley. _EOL_ And yet that's what he was driving when he crashed. _EOL_ I don't know what happened, why he was in that car, but there's a perfectly innocent explanation. _EOL_ Well, thank you for your time. We will need to speak to Mrs Wicks. _EOL_ Just not today. _EOL_ Officer. _EOL_ And you are? _EOL_ Yolande Trueman. _EOL_ A friend of the family. Helping out. Is Denise still asleep? _EOL_ Yes. _EOL_ See? Some other time. _EOL_ Well? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Have they any idea what was going on? Why it happened? _EOL_ Tragic accident. _EOL_ What is it? _EOL_ There's no need. _EOL_ Something to do. _EOL_ Yeah. I'm sorry...about all the money you lost. _EOL_ I hadn't even thought about it. _EOL_ Still... _EOL_ Actually, it's not that much. Denise was sorting out a loan at the post office. _EOL_ For the six grand? _EOL_ Yes. _EOL_ So...you didn't write out a cheque, or anything like that. _EOL_ No. Just gave her £500 deposit. _EOL_ Cash or cheque? _EOL_ Cash. _EOL_ And the registration documents? _EOL_ Denise was going to send them off. _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ What's so important about how I paid? _EOL_ No reason. Hated the idea of you being out of pocket, I suppose. _EOL_ Who worries about money at a time like this? _EOL_ Something to do. _EOL_ Darren. _EOL_ Is Libby...? _EOL_ You're back. _EOL_ Yeah. I was wondering if you fancied, you know, a bit of fresh air or something...maybe try out the skates I got you... _EOL_ Don't worry about the girls. We'll be fine. _EOL_ Tanya. _EOL_ Never better. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ We'll all be fine. Look after the salon. _EOL_ If you say so. _EOL_ I understand. _EOL_ I like to think so. _EOL_ I'm dying for a pee. _EOL_ It's important to drink. Don't wanna dehydrate. _EOL_ Glad to see someone's having fun. _EOL_ And we wouldn't want anything getting in the way of you having fun, would we? _EOL_ Had a bit of dignity. _EOL_ Hello? I tell you, that was some night. Blimey. What's the matter, someone die or something? _EOL_ How're you doing? _EOL_ It feels funny. _EOL_ You doing them up right? _EOL_ I mean, being here. Like I'm, I don't know, everybody's at home trying to...deal with...and I'm... _EOL_ We could go and get something to drink if you like. The kiosk's open. _EOL_ No. It's okay. _EOL_ I mean, the skates aren't... It was just a thought. _EOL_ I know. _EOL_ I couldn't face...staying in. _EOL_ Not on my own. Just...thinking. Things I could've done... _EOL_ Like what? _EOL_ Bet you can't do fifty metres on them. _EOL_ Bet I can do a hundred. There and back. _EOL_ How much? _EOL_ Bag of chips. _EOL_ Throw in a saveloy and we've got us a contest. _EOL_ Felt like coming here. _EOL_ That's a lie. I'm hiding. _EOL_ I've got a visiting day booked... I don't have the words. How do I tell him Dad is dead? _EOL_ How am I gonna tell him? What's it gonna do to him? Of all the stupid, selfish... Why did he have to die? _EOL_ I should go. Deano'll be expecting me. _EOL_ You? _EOL_ Come on, then. Maybe you can make sense of it for all of us. _EOL_ Gonna give me a little lecture? The evils of alcohol? _EOL_ Then what're you still doing here? _EOL_ Please. _EOL_ ‚Cause you didn't mean to hurt me. _EOL_ I was just, what? An innocent bystander. _EOL_ So what's it gonna be? Money? Your car? _EOL_ You'd give anything, you said. I'm intrigued. _EOL_ How about a finger? _EOL_ -Which would be ironic, ‚cos you've kind of already given me that... _EOL_ Or better yet, the whole arm. How about that? You think that would do the job? _EOL_ Go away. You must hate me so much. _EOL_ You have to, to do what you did. _EOL_ Police gone? _EOL_ They didn't kick the door in? _EOL_ I was gonna...but there was this party and I was thinking about what I was gonna wear and I sort of, you know... _EOL_ Yes. _EOL_ I'm really sorry, I didn't think-- _EOL_ She did say sorry. _EOL_ You're sacking me? Happy New Year. _EOL_ It was an honest mistake. _EOL_ I'm sorry things have been so tough for you. But don't take it out on us. It's not nice. _EOL_ ...I'll be up tomorrow, dear. Tell Jim I'll try to come in the morning. No, everything's fine... I have to go, Carol. Yes. See you tomorrow. What're you doing here? _EOL_ Oh. In the kitchen. _EOL_ Please. I can't go home, not while everyone's... I've been walking around but hardly anywhere's open. I'm cold and I could really do with a cup of tea. So... Thanks. _EOL_ The usual, I suppose. Everyone sitting around wondering what just hit them... _EOL_ If ever. _EOL_ Still. Time heals and all that. That's what they say. Doesn't though, does it? I'll just sit at the back, if that's okay. _EOL_ How many people, Max? Not just your wife and kids. Bradley. Stacey, Charlie, Jean. Sean. Me. All these lives. Look what you did. _EOL_ If you say that and don't mean it, you'll go to hell. _EOL_ Dad! _EOL_ Does Mum know you're here? _EOL_ You should go. _EOL_ No, stay. Just for a while. _EOL_ Please? _EOL_ You know, earlier. When you said there were things you could've done. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ You did nothing wrong. _EOL_ No? _EOL_ He really cared about you. You can't blame yourself. _EOL_ No. I know. _EOL_ Thanks for today. _EOL_ Seven stages. _EOL_ I read somewhere. Seven stages of grief. Right now, it feels like seventy-seven. _EOL_ I don't know...something so sudden, so impossible to...it brings you together as a family. Or it pulls you apart. I've seen it happen. And that's the worst thing...because all there is is more pain, grief...anger...like there wasn't enough already. _EOL_ Whatever. _EOL_ Me? _EOL_ He was my friend. _EOL_ Yes, but-- _EOL_ It just sort of happened. _EOL_ So. Just the five of us, then, is it? _EOL_ Bradley? I was getting worried. _EOL_ Are you drunk? _EOL_ I sincerely hope so. _EOL_ Bradley... _EOL_ You're wonderful, you are. And I'm...I'm sorry. You've got enough on your, I mean with Grandad all, you know, and then all this and it's not fair, I know you don't need me to worry about as well, so don't, I'm fine, I will be, one day, just not... I think I'm gonna be ill. _EOL_ Hello? This is Dorothy. Branning. It's about Bradley. I think you need to come here. Quickly. _EOL_ He left at the usual time? _EOL_ Bradley's a stickler for punctuality. Practically set your watch by him. _EOL_ Well I've not seen him today. _EOL_ Did you want him for anything in particular? _EOL_ No. So long as he's not bunking off. _EOL_ Bradley wouldn't do that. _EOL_ That was the MarketInspector. Now, hurry, he might not notice. _EOL_ In a minute. I think I had one too many last night. _EOL_ And then ten more after that. You don't want to get into trouble. _EOL_ I'll be fine. He's all mouth and no trousers. _EOL_ Let's not put it to the test. _EOL_ Do you have to go in again today? _EOL_ Why aren't we in the kitchen, like normal? _EOL_ Lauren finished the milk. As usual. _EOL_ It's okay. _EOL_ You've crossed the line. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Your stall. You're in the wrong place. _EOL_ You have to observe the allocation. _EOL_ Fine. I'll remember that tomorrow. _EOL_ You'll do it today. _EOL_ When I next come by. Okay? _EOL_ ...that's the thing, you see. You've gotta let the teabag do its work and then take it out before putting in the milk. On account of the fact that the fat molecules in the milk are bigger than the holes in the teabag, which clogs up the bag and stops it working. Common mistake. And while we're on the subject, you should actually put the milk in last because-- _EOL_ Dad. _EOL_ Yeah? _EOL_ I don't care. I don't care about tea. Or Rorke's Drift. Or how kidneys work. Or anything else you've been banging on about today, okay? _EOL_ I was just trying to, you know... _EOL_ Take my mind of things. _EOL_ Yeah. Is it working? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Darren... _EOL_ I'm doing my best, Darren. _EOL_ Great. _EOL_ What do you want, son? _EOL_ I don't know. I don't want to feel like this. I can't help Libby. I can't do anything. I just want it back the way it was. I want to stop feeling like this. Can you do that? _EOL_ I don't know how to. _EOL_ Kevin would. _EOL_ If you hadn't sacked me, I'd've probably quit. I've felt...like this for a while. Yesterday just...made me realise. _EOL_ That there's gotta be something, you know, more. Different. _EOL_ I'll think about it. _EOL_ Dad! _EOL_ Are you gonna have tea with us again? _EOL_ Today? _EOL_ Had to go in to work. I'm with Ben, Lauren's gone over to Lucy's. _EOL_ I wish you were still at home. _EOL_ I miss you. _EOL_ See anything funny? _EOL_ Allocation. _EOL_ ...Mrs Masood came into the shop earlier. She said they were going round later with a big curry. _EOL_ That's really kind of them. _EOL_ So I thought I'd do a stew. Something that you just reheat... _EOL_ Yolande... _EOL_ It's the basic things people forget sometimes. Practical help, like food... _EOL_ Yolande. I need to let you in on a few things. _EOL_ How d'you mean? _EOL_ Why Kevin was driving your car. Why he was in such a hurry. Why we all have to tell the police the same thing. _EOL_ The police? I don't understand. _EOL_ Do you know what a cut and shut is? _EOL_ No-one was ever meant to know. Yours was the last car. _EOL_ I see. _EOL_ All he was doing was trying to make things right. _EOL_ The car was a death trap. _EOL_ Yes. And the minute Kevin found out... _EOL_ You said something about talking to the police. _EOL_ They can never know where you bought the car. Right now, there's no paper trail to Kevin and that's how it must stay. _EOL_ I see. You want me to lie. _EOL_ For the kids' sake. Knowing Kevin was involved in something illegal. That--in some way--it killed him...how will that help them? _EOL_ An accessory, I think they call it. After the fact. _EOL_ I wouldn't put it like that. _EOL_ It's not really about how you'd put it, is it? I should go. _EOL_ Yolande. You know what it'll cost the kids. I'm sorry you're in this position. _EOL_ She wants to make me a manager. _EOL_ Great. _EOL_ I just don't know if it's enough to make me want to stay. I mean... if there was another reason to stay... _EOL_ Such as? _EOL_ You know how sometimes there're things that you really...long for...and you're prepared to wait forever to get them? _EOL_ Yeah...I think so. _EOL_ Have you ever felt like that? Longed for something? _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ A Gameboy. To play Donkey Kong. I'd've killed for one of them. _EOL_ Donkey Kong. _EOL_ You've gotta love that little fella. _EOL_ Gotta run. _EOL_ No, it's okay. You've been a big help. _EOL_ Knocked her a bit. _EOL_ How'd you mean? _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'JACK': \"Oi. Where have you been? Huh? What were the texts about? _EOL_ Well I've got mates here I wanted to have a chat with them, instead I've been serving behind the bar. _EOL_ It's on the house. Are you alright? _EOL_ I left the night wallet at home. I'm gonna be about ten minutes. _EOL_ Are you alright? You've been a bit off since you got here. _EOL_ So that's why you were late? You had a little set up planned? _EOL_ Well, how about I pour you a glass of this and take you through what might've happened. So, I would've given you this. Then what? _EOL_ And then? _EOL_ Fair dos. I think we talk, we'd have a laugh and then that moment would come. _EOL_ The moment where we're too close for it to be friends. The one where I can smell the perfume on your skin and I wonder who is brave enough to ... _EOL_ Tea. _EOL_ Nice hotels not far. Go to one of them. Or do you only like to do that when you're cheating on Tanya? _EOL_ Not much, no. You've got a perfectly good house of your own. Which you'd be in if you hadn't so royally screwed up. Go, stay, I don't care. But all this? It's down to you. Put up or shut up. _EOL_ You sure you're not just saying that to make me feel good? _EOL_ Where're you going? _EOL_ I intend to. _EOL_ Ronnie around? _EOL_ Can I see her? _EOL_ Won't take a minute. _EOL_ Oh. _EOL_ We're meant to be getting together later. We've got an 18th in the club coming up. Need to go over a few things. Tell her to come round later, yeah? _EOL_ You know the Police're asking questions about what happened to Kevin Wicks. _EOL_ Watch your back, that's all I'm saying. _EOL_ I was expecting Ronnie. _EOL_ Yes. _EOL_ A bit. _EOL_ You made it then. _EOL_ Go? Thought we'd just eat here...you know... working lunch? _EOL_ Is that a problem? _EOL_ Can you grab the blue file that I've left in the _EOL_ And not an egg mayo sarnie in sight.. _EOL_ Don't know what you mean. _EOL_ I never said it was more. _EOL_ I thought women liked surprises. _EOL_ I'm not playing you. Not saying I wouldn't like to... _EOL_ Not guilty. _EOL_ I can. _EOL_ And why would I promise something I couldn't deliver? _EOL_ Whatever you think - _EOL_ I think you know that I can. _EOL_ It's me. Got any updates on the mother and daughter?... Do not try and fob me off! I don't care, just drop everything else, or I'll be round to drop you. _EOL_ Follow me. _EOL_ So you could buy me a drink. _EOL_ I found her, Phil. I found your daughter. _EOL_ It was emailed this morning. Friend of mine, he staked out the address yesterday afternoon. _EOL_ Yeah, I gave it to Phil last night. Didn't he tell you? _EOL_ Pint. Phil around? _EOL_ Where? _EOL_ Bit. _EOL_ Bloke got lucky, that's all. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ Won't happen again. _EOL_ Mornin'. _EOL_ Reckon it suits me? It's my favourite colour. _EOL_ Been asking myself the same thing. If this is what I get for trying to help, I wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him. _EOL_ Don't be. I'm a big boy now. _EOL_ Ron. The naked look suits you. GO _EOL_ What are you doing hiding in here? _EOL_ Didn't think I'd see you tonight. _EOL_ Mitchell factor. Circling the wagons. _EOL_ Which is one of the things I like about you. We still solvent? _EOL_ What can I do? _EOL_ He's so predictable. _EOL_ I did my bit. If Phil can't handle it, it's his problem. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Ronnie wait. _EOL_ From this place? Or from me? _EOL_ Why would you walk away from your business? You're the one making it personal... _EOL_ Can't stand to breathe the same air as me now? _EOL_ Why run away in that case? _EOL_ Sorry if I make you feel uncomfortable. _EOL_ I meant about Phil. _EOL_ Maybe I made a mistake by getting involved, but I knew how huge it was for him. Missing out on all those years ... watching his kids change, grow. _EOL_ I wouldn't wish that on anyone. _EOL_ But you're right. Phil hates my guts, and you don't deserve to be in the middle of it. _EOL_ Ronnie. _EOL_ No, course not. _EOL_ Yeah. Now that you're here. Thanks Ron. _EOL_ Shouldn't the stripper be here by now? _EOL_ Didn't you? _EOL_ I've had other things on my mind. _EOL_ ...I know it's short notice but we're desperate. You can? Oh mate...I really owe you one. Get him over here asap will you? French Maid? Ain't a tranny actis he? I told you, I don't want a woman, I want a bloke! Yeah very funny. _EOL_ Tried everyone. Nothing. _EOL_ Let you down. Sorry Ron. _EOL_ I'm sorting it! _EOL_ Don't ask. _EOL_ Ladies. Would you like to take your places for the show? _EOL_ Told you I'd sort it, didn't I? _EOL_ I'm not a stripper. _EOL_ Sorry sweetheart, I'm taken. _EOL_ Yeah, bye. _EOL_ Girls have gone away happy. Am I a genius or what? _EOL_ You gonna dob me in? _EOL_ Let's just say he's expecting a bit extra in his pay packet this month. _EOL_ Lucky it wasn't ripped to shreds. Women eh? whoever called 'em the weaker sex was having a laugh. The look on your face... you thought it was going to be me, didn't you? _EOL_ You disappointed? _EOL_ Could give you a private show if you like. Come on, I'll let you wear my hat. _EOL_ Stay. ENDS _EOL_ You're not getting up to make me breakfast, are you. It was a mistake, right? We shouldn't have done it and let's forget it ever happened. _EOL_ What if I don't want to? What if I want this to happen again? _EOL_ Hey, get back to bed. This is meant to be a surprise. _EOL_ Yes, well, make the most of it. It's your turn next time. If there is a next time, obviously. Which I am in no way presuming. Cos we're business partners, and still very respectful of each other's boundaries - _EOL_ You're going to have to tell your family sometime. _EOL_ I won't lie about it. If people ask, I'm going to say what's happened. _EOL_ And what sort of respect are you showing me? _EOL_ How d'you want your eggs? Scrambled or fried? _EOL_ Why, what did I miss? _EOL_ Trust me. I'm good. How are you doing? Phil. Good to see you. Look, I'm sorry it didn't work out. With Louise. Just as long as you know - I was trying to help. Let's take that from it and move on, yes? Hey Roxy. Peggy. _EOL_ No. I'm not stopping. There's no point. This ain't about us all having a drink and pretending to like each other for a false half hour - it's about starting again. Properly. I've got to prove myself to you all. I know that. So I've just come here now to say, I hope you'll give me that chance. _EOL_ I know. Thanks. Sorry but, like you said, best not to push people faster than they want to go. _EOL_ I'm going to go back and start preparing the club. Why don't you stay here for a bit? Talk me up. I think I need it. _EOL_ Nice suit. _EOL_ No problem. Not as long as you've earned it. _EOL_ Coffee, please. Black, no sugar. I thought it was your turn to make breakfast? _EOL_ A dead one if I catch you. How about you disinfect it while you're waiting? _EOL_ You either clean that sink, right now, or get out. _EOL_ But you like putting that thought in my head. Don't you? _EOL_ Small man. Still needing his small victories. Even though it costs him his family. _EOL_ Thanks for coming. This is better, isn't it? We can talk properly now. Say what we want to say. Rather than what people we care about want to hear. _EOL_ No, that was true. I do want us to get on. I like Ronnie, so obviously, it's in my interests. But it's not in your interests, is it Phil? You're thinking - why should I make the effort to get along with this cocky gitwho I don't even like. _EOL_ Here's why. _EOL_ And with all this new evidence - they still might. _EOL_ You're a stupid man, Phil. You pick fights with people you know nothing about, with no understanding of how they might react. Well, you know now, don't you? _EOL_ It's enough. With what the police already have? More than. You sold stolen cars to Kevin Wicks who then died driving one - Yes, that's it. Keep thinking with your fists. Make it even easier for me, why don't you? No, there's no-one else here. And I ain't recording it neither, but you've had your cheap sucker punch. You want to go toe to toe when my back ain't turned, let's do it - see how long you last. _EOL_ For the tape? Nothing. I'm going to give you it back. It's just a warning, Phil. Take me seriously. Treat me with respect. _EOL_ That and the car lot, yes. _EOL_ You're going to sell me the freehold for the car lot. At half the market price. As a way of apologizing. Let's call it a gesture of friendship. _EOL_ That's bad news for Ben, isn't it? Cos once I give that tape to the police, you won't be seeing him for quite a while. _EOL_ More than you ever did. See, I make it my business to know exactly who I'm dealing with, what they're capable of. Shame you never did the same. Just be grateful all I want is the car lot. You've got until 5pm. _EOL_ I know. Peggy does. That's not my problem. _EOL_ You tell Ronnie this, the tape goes to the police. You threaten Darren, it goes to the police. This is just between you and me. To clear the air. Make things even between us. See, I really did try and help you with Louise, Phil, and now you owe me something in return. So why don't you phone your bent solicitor Ritchie Scott and start saving yourself while you still can. _EOL_ I am doing it. _EOL_ Phil, what are you drinking? _EOL_ Hey Peggy? When you're ready. One more for the road, yes? _EOL_ Phil, come and join us. _EOL_ Same again all round, only let's make it doubles - We're celebrating, after all - and you've got join us this time, Peggy. No excuses. _EOL_ I know. Change of plan. _EOL_ You might have mentioned Phil had bribed you beforehand. 200 notes to keep quiet? That makes you an accomplice, you muppet. I give that tape to the police now you two'll be sharing a cell - is that how you want this to go? Well? Look, you wanted revenge for Kevin, right? _EOL_ And that's exactly what he's going to do. He's going to pay by giving you the car lot. The freehold, it's yours. That's right. He'll sign it over to me first, then I'll give it to you when you're 18. _EOL_ Don't worry. He can't touch you. _EOL_ Trust me. _EOL_ Darren, listen - _EOL_ Just get a grip, okay? Look at me. You're going to be fine. Phil won't hurt you. I guarantee it. Now sit down. And listen up, cos what you decide here Darren, is going to determine how the rest of your life goes. _EOL_ I chose you for a reason, Darren. You're ambitious, motivated and you've got a world of guts - not many people would've agreed to take Phil Mitchell on. But you need to prove to me you can live with the pressure of the choices you make. Do that, and you'll be owning a lot more than a crappy car lot in a few years time. See, what I'm offering you here, is an apprenticeship. If you can't handle it just say so now. I'll give you some money, you can head off, start again somewhere else. Or you can accept the risk, stay here, and learn how to really play the game. It's up to you. That or this. What are you going to do? _EOL_ You're late. _EOL_ What are you having? _EOL_ See, that's sharp. I like that. We could really get on, you and me - if you just gave us a chance. _EOL_ That's the original - on the memory card. And that's the copy I made for the sound system this morning. _EOL_ Like I said, this makes us even. All I want now, Phil, is your friendship. You need a favour from me, it's yours. Just ask. That's how this thing should work. _EOL_ No hard feelings then. _EOL_ Long term view. _EOL_ You worked really hard over the weekend. There's a nice little tip in there for you. _EOL_ Do you wanna tell Dawn about tonight? _EOL_ Yeah. It is. That's why we had to employ some agency staff. _EOL_ It's just a one _EOL_ Look, it's gonna be a sophisticated bunch tonight. _EOL_ is that for me? _EOL_ Do what you need to do. _EOL_ Nice try. But I think you won the bet hours ago. _EOL_ Out the back. _EOL_ What are you doing working back here? _EOL_ So how did the apology go down? _EOL_ Look this thing between you two and your dad - what's the big deal? _EOL_ But you still going to Phil's birthday do? _EOL_ The offer's still open, you know. _EOL_ Here, Phil. Ronnie tells me it's your birthday soon. _EOL_ well she's just invited me to your do. You don't mind, do you? _EOL_ I'm just checking. I might even buy you a present. _EOL_ Well isn't that the idea? _EOL_ Where you going? _EOL_ Just gonna slip off were ya? _EOL_ I don't know if I'd call it. Not after last nights performance. _EOL_ Oh come on, Five more minutes. _EOL_ What's the rush? _EOL_ That's not till tonight is it? _EOL_ Oh yeah yeah. It's the first thing I thought about when I woke up. _EOL_ Is that all I get then? _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ Er, no. _EOL_ Oh, it's my daughters. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ Look I just wanna get on with this. _EOL_ If we're going over the Vic, why did you come over here for me? _EOL_ What like a proper married couple? _EOL_ You look lovely. _EOL_ It's gonna be fine. _EOL_ Yeah, happy birthday. _EOL_ I got you this. It's perfect for a special occasion. _EOL_ Yeah, you wouldn't know it wasn't the real deal. _EOL_ Mmm, I love venison. _EOL_ Yeah, I'd be happy to. _EOL_ I didn't realise you were fifty Phil? _EOL_ You not worred about getting old? _EOL_ Oh, I would. Not being able to do what I used to do. You know, getting tired, losing my edge, losing my... _EOL_ Well you can see that. You're full of youth. _EOL_ How's the wine, Peggy? _EOL_ Oh, watch it, you're going to get me drunk. _EOL_ Oh there's no chance of that, I mean you can handle your drink can't ya?. _EOL_ That was delicious, Peggy. _EOL_ So did you really make this yourself? _EOL_ So I thought we were mates. _EOL_ Aren't we? I thought we were, that's why you sold me the car lot. _EOL_ What? Hasn't he told you? Yeah he was desperate, so he sold it to me at a knock down price. _EOL_ Yeah, thanks for dinner Peggy. _EOL_ And? _EOL_ Oh it's just business. _EOL_ Our paths crossed. Alright? I don't know. _EOL_ Look he was desperate. I was just helping him out. What are you worried about? _EOL_ I'm gonna open up, I'll see you down there. _EOL_ You can't expect me to get on with everyone. Besides, I'm an ex-cop. Phil's a - _EOL_ Same as Roxy, same as Peggy. I don't have a problem with them. _EOL_ SO what d'you wanna know? _EOL_ Purple. Now, d'you really think this is getting us anywhere? Cos I've got some _EOL_ You can ask me anything you like. We'll talk, play twenty questions. When I get back. Right now, I've gotta go an' renew my tax disc. _EOL_ So, where were we? That's right, questions... _EOL_ When? _EOL_ What the date on that? _EOL_ Ah. I'm sorry... that's a no can do. _EOL_ Kind of - My daughter. It's her birthday. I said I'd take her to the ballet. She's dance mad, didn't I tell ya? _EOL_ Yeah it is. Try as I might they wouldn't put on another performance. _EOL_ Don't I? _EOL_ Look when things went wrong between me and Selina - There was a lot of unfinished business, a lot of arguing. That wasn't good, for any of us. Least of all Penny. I agreed to keep my distance. _EOL_ Yeah... _EOL_ We? _EOL_ You'd come with us? _EOL_ I'd like that. Penny would, I know she would. _EOL_ Look, I know it's been hard for you recently, what with your family putting pressure on you. _EOL_ Good. That's why, I wanted to give you these. I mean if you're gonna be coming round alot more now. _EOL_ I'm not messing around, Ronnie. I want it to work. Do you? _EOL_ Just wanted to say thanks. Looks like it's gonna be a busy night. _EOL_ Jack Branning charm. Gets ‚em in the end. _EOL_ Dawn's not answering her phone. Thought I better get stuck in. _EOL_ Then I thought I'd go home, you know, have a shower, clean up. And invite you out to dinner. So we can talk. I know that's what you want, so, from now on, we'll spend more time together - _EOL_ It's not how it looks, you don't know the half of it. _EOL_ Kenny Nelson, he was a drug dealer. We're talking major league, exporting, importing. Met'd been after him for years. And I was the one that got him. I sent him down for twelve years. There was a load of press. Load of kudos. Oh, an' I made sure everyone knew. He was my body. Couple of months later - Penny and Selina were at a bus stop. Car mounts the pavement. Mows them both down. _EOL_ Penny was eight. Some scroat, that owed Nelson big time. _EOL_ Yeah. Didn't he make sure I knew it. Selina got hurt, she broke her arm, fractured collar bone. But Penny - She severed her spine. She won't walk again. Me and Selina we stayed together at first. Just getting through it, day by day. But I'd catch her watching me, you know, looking at me. I knew that weren't love in her eyes. _EOL_ No. If I'd nicked Nelson, stood back, kept quiet. But no, Jack Branning, he can't. he has to rub his nose in it, don't he. Anyway we couldn't get past it. So we agreed. Her terms.And I kept my distance. _EOL_ I haven't lived a perfect life, Ronnie. If you're gonna jump every time someone whispers - _EOL_ I'm gonna go and get cleaned up. _EOL_ No I'm tired. I'm just gonna take it easy tonight. _EOL_ Well, I thought I'd surprise you. _EOL_ Well I brought your presents. _EOL_ Well whatever it is, you're not allowed to open them until tomorrow. But I was wondering - _EOL_ About maybe taking you out for a meal. _EOL_ Just a thought - _EOL_ Look I don't want to create any trouble - _EOL_ It's the attic. _EOL_ No it's that one. _EOL_ Well I'm moving. Tomorrow. Maybe sooner. _EOL_ I'll catch you later yeah? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Come on. _EOL_ Right. I best be getting off. _EOL_ Yeah I am. _EOL_ We've got that events manager coming round later this afternoon. You hadn't forgotten had you? Could be a regular booking for us, once a fortnight, it's exactly what we need now that Christmas is over. _EOL_ Yeah well. I had things to do. _EOL_ My business. _EOL_ Some kind of dance night I think. _EOL_ Look whatever it is, it's business. _EOL_ Meaning if you can't keep your foul mood in check then maybe I should see him alone. _EOL_ This is Ronnie Mitchell, my business partner. _EOL_ Yeah, this is it. _EOL_ We do our best. _EOL_ So what sort of club are you exactly, Mr Walters? _EOL_ Nah, I just got the phone call. _EOL_ Right. _EOL_ Maybe we could join in. _EOL_ I'm sure the staff wouldn't mind if we explained it to them. _EOL_ Might be a bit cold for Jase on the door though. _EOL_ It's not happening either. _EOL_ I didn't. _EOL_ Trust me. Look Ronnie - I just wanted- _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ I'll come later. _EOL_ Look I wanted to be there too. But we both know what would have happened if I'd stayed. _EOL_ We're not living together anymore. _EOL_ There's no future in it. _EOL_ Maybe. _EOL_ I said. Maybe. _EOL_ You'll never be in the past, how can you, Penny'll make sure of that if nothing else. _EOL_ Told me what? _EOL_ Out of the flat? _EOL_ Where are you going? _EOL_ So, um, what's this, payback? _EOL_ You lashing out because I didn't stay over. _EOL_ So what is this then? Coincidence? _EOL_ No, you're not taking her away from me. _EOL_ Look - we got it sorted. _EOL_ I've moved out. _EOL_ It's only 'cause you keep letting me. _EOL_ What? Cuts the other one out you mean. _EOL_ Well it might as well be, when you're in this sort of mood. _EOL_ Selina, please - _EOL_ What does this mean - what does that mean? _EOL_ I don't know. _EOL_ So why this? Why last night? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ See you later. And good morning to you too Roxanne. _EOL_ Yes thanks. You? _EOL_ Roxy - _EOL_ Yeah well I suppose you could tell her if you like - _EOL_ But there doesn't seem much point, seeing as how it looks like Ronnie's had enough of me and cleared off. _EOL_ And there was me thinking you were looking out for Ronnie. _EOL_ And besides, even _EOL_ You're full of surprises. _EOL_ Yeah I noticed. I particularly enjoyed that bit. _EOL_ Well you shouldn't have gone behind my back. _EOL_ But if that's the way you apologise, feel free to mess up anytime you like. _EOL_ So does this mean we're back together? _EOL_ What, you ashamed of me? _EOL_ If that's what you want. _EOL_ Let's go back to bed? _EOL_ What's the rush? _EOL_ Why you so worried about what she thinks. _EOL_ If she winds you up so much, why don't you just move out. _EOL_ Yeah. Why not. _EOL_ I was being serious. _EOL_ Sounds like avoidance to me. _EOL_ And the point to this character assassination is? _EOL_ Ronnie came to see me. _EOL_ Yeah, it was actually. _EOL_ If you don't believe me, ask Ronnie. _EOL_ Go ahead. _EOL_ If you wanna ruin the one piece of happiness Ronnie's had in god knows how long. _EOL_ See that's the problem, Roxy. I think you're doing this for all the wrong reasons. I think you don't like being side lined. You can't stand not being the centre of Ronnie's universe. And you'd hate any man who got close to her. _EOL_ I made a mistake with Selena. _EOL_ Alright, we got _EOL_ That's all very well Dot but dad's gonna need constant care. _EOL_ Well maybe dad won't want his friends to see him...like he is. You know how much of a proud man he is. Look all I'm saying is you might wanna think about the nursing home. Just for a little while. Til he gets stronger. _EOL_ I mean there are some great nursing homes out there and if it's a question of money - _EOL_ OK. If you're sure. _EOL_ Easy when you know how. Something I said? _EOL_ Well maybe you should take me up on my offer. _EOL_ Maybe. But there's only one way to find out. Or maybe you're scared. Big step. Living with a bloke. You've never done that before, have you. _EOL_ Well sometimes you just gotta take that leap. _EOL_ No guarantees. But I can guarantee you a lot less grief than living with your sister. Unless you wanna carry on living with your sister. I can see it now. YOu two growing old together. Knitting cardies, drawing your pensions. _EOL_ Now you're talking. Tell you what - late lunch on me, at Fargo's. Celebrate you moving in. _EOL_ Well if you turn up, that'll be your answer. I'll be waiting. _EOL_ Hi this is Jack. I'm not in right now so leave a message. _EOL_ Okay thanks. Sorry. We've got a strict door policy here. It's bit early for you, isn't it? _EOL_ What? Can't she come round herself? _EOL_ Look, this is stupid isn't it? Selina. It didn't mean anything to me. _EOL_ Yeah well that was a mistake. _EOL_ You've always had it in for me, ain't you? _EOL_ Roxy. We both know that ain't the reason. _EOL_ She was leaving you behind and you hated it. _EOL_ I'm Jack. _EOL_ Dot says you wanna come to my club. Told me I've gotta take care of you. _EOL_ Yeah, well so was I til now. Listen, when you arrive don't bother queueing up, go straight to the front, tell the doorman I'm expecting you. You like champagne, yeah? _EOL_ I'll see you there then. _EOL_ Alright, get that inside you. _EOL_ Oh. _EOL_ Excuse me. _EOL_ Yeah, okay mate hang on. Sorry, I'm gonna have to take this - you can go anywhere you like - alright - the VIP is yours. _EOL_ Yeah of course. _EOL_ There's no reason for you to be checking the books - it's Friday night. _EOL_ Fine. When you've decided you've been punished enough, you let me know, okay? _EOL_ Guess who's back. Bradley. _EOL_ Well I don't s'pose you're gonna be top of his list. He's got his bag. Looks like he's back for good. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'RONNIE': \"Nothing. Nothing. I'll be with you in two minutes yeah? _EOL_ Alright. Two minutes. _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ Proper little detective aren't you? _EOL_ I'd have drunk it. _EOL_ I'm doing all the work here Jack, that doesn't bode _EOL_ What moment's that then? _EOL_ Oi. What the hell is going on here? _EOL_ Listen, you have been spoiling for this all night. Home, now. _EOL_ Get out. _EOL_ Course not. I'm sorry about Jase. _EOL_ I think I've got someone in line already. _EOL_ Nah. He'll keep. _EOL_ 2008, best year yet. _EOL_ ‚Course I can. _EOL_ You know a better reason? _EOL_ And whose fault's that? _EOL_ Usually, the sell-by date's a clue. _EOL_ I notice you didn't have any. _EOL_ Let you cook? Take a look at me. You think it's a good idea? _EOL_ I'm fine. _EOL_ That's right. I said I'd go over. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Then you'll have to go. _EOL_ Your prawns. Your bad. _EOL_ As well as can be expected. _EOL_ Thanks, Auntie Peg. _EOL_ I haven't got a bloke. _EOL_ We're meeting about business, yes. _EOL_ Which is? _EOL_ I'm not sure I like the way you're asking me. _EOL_ Jack? _EOL_ Yeah... are you ready to go? _EOL_ Oh, right. _EOL_ No, ‚course not... _EOL_ Proper little game-player, aren't you, Jack? _EOL_ You told me business, made me think it's more - _EOL_ Trying to knock me off-balance... And then this. _EOL_ Sometimes... _EOL_ You've only been here five minutes, and here you are, playing me, playing Phil - _EOL_ But Phil? _EOL_ Promising you can get Louise's address? What's that all about? _EOL_ Don't be daft, you saw where he's vulnerable, and you pounced - _EOL_ Gives you power, keeps him under control. _EOL_ I think you like people in your pocket. I think you like pulling strings. I think you'd offer someone the earth if you thought they wanted it badly enough... I'm just not sure you're the kind of man who can deliver. _EOL_ The books look fine. Thanks for lunch. I'll see you later. _EOL_ Can't find Phil anywhere. _EOL_ You're drinking too much, too quick. Go home. _EOL_ You know Peggy don't like staff drinking here. _EOL_ Home. Now. _EOL_ Ouch. Turning a very fetching shade of blue I see? _EOL_ What made Phil lose it like that? _EOL_ I'm sorry. _EOL_ He didn't... _EOL_ What did you do Phil? _EOL_ Leave it Aunt Peg. _EOL_ I'm sorry about Louise, but how can you blame Jack? _EOL_ He did what he said Phil. He was trying to help you. _EOL_ Of course. He found her for you, didn't he? If you want to shoot the messenger then that's... . _EOL_ No, how could he..? _EOL_ But why would he? I mean... _EOL_ I can't believe he'd do that. It sounds so paranoid. Let's face it, Phil's never liked Jack. _EOL_ Not you as well. _EOL_ That's rubbish. _EOL_ You're an idiot. _EOL_ I'm not. _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ No-one tells me what to do. _EOL_ He's in pieces. So's Aunt Peg. If you'd seen her... _EOL_ Phil thinks you set him up. That you knew Louise had a step-dad. _EOL_ Did you Jack? _EOL_ That's not an answer. It's all about scoring points with you two. Tit for tat. You win, he loses and vice versa. Boys playing their war games. _EOL_ You know what Jack? You can wind each other up till your ears start to bleed for all I care. _EOL_ But there's a six year old girl stuck in the middle of this, and that ain't right. _EOL_ You're on your own from now on. I'm taking a break. _EOL_ You're the cop. You work it out. _EOL_ Jack. No. I can't. Why would I change my mind? _EOL_ Don't kid yourself. _EOL_ I'm not. Vic's short-handed. Promised I'd help. _EOL_ You don't. _EOL_ I know that. _EOL_ Jack... _EOL_ Before you get too excited, I'm here for the hens, not you. If you've forgotten the hen party Jack... _EOL_ So everything's under control? _EOL_ Hello ladies. Welcome to R&R. Hope you're ready to have a good time? _EOL_ I'm sure he'll push all the right buttons. The VIP room's all set up for you, if you‚d like to go through. Champagne cocktails on the way. _EOL_ Jack? _EOL_ Didn't you ring to confirm? _EOL_ Jack. _EOL_ Yeah me too. _EOL_ He's...been delayed. _EOL_ He'll be here. _EOL_ She really does, doesn't she? _EOL_ No-one's gonna be disappointed, I promise you. Next round for these ladies is on the house. Whatever you like. _EOL_ Well? _EOL_ We can't blow this Jack. Their company could send a hell of a lot of business our way. It could make us. _EOL_ Where are you going? _EOL_ You're not leaving me to deal with it... Jack! _EOL_ How about some games eh? You know...truth or dare, guess what's in the handbag, consequences... _EOL_ Where have you been? They're gonna walk in a minute. _EOL_ Jack... you're not... ? _EOL_ Ain't it illegal? Using your old uniform like that? _EOL_ Maybe I should. So, how did you manage to talk Neil into it? _EOL_ Wouldn't put it past you. _EOL_ As if. _EOL_ Idiot. _EOL_ Something like that. _EOL_ You'll be disappointed. _EOL_ Not a lot. _EOL_ Yes, that's what I need, Max. Insight. From the man who slept with his son's teenage fiancee - _EOL_ And this new found awareness means you'll never cheat on her again. Right? _EOL_ It's good you're so grateful to him. Helping you out, putting a roof over your head - _EOL_ Say the same thing to Tanya, would you? If she asked you to come home? You're right. We're all hypocrites, Max. But it's what you do about it that counts. _EOL_ It's that, alright. _EOL_ Shut up. _EOL_ Whoah, slow down - we've got an audience, remember. Max won't say anything, will he? _EOL_ When there's something worth telling them about. Yes. _EOL_ No, you'll say, ask Ronnie. I deserve that much respect at least. _EOL_ I'm still here, aren't I? Don't push me faster than I want to go. It's my family. My rules. Okay? _EOL_ Poached. _EOL_ Hey Roxy. What's up? _EOL_ No, I stayed at the club last night. I got really drunk, just crashed on the sofa there. I'm coming home now. _EOL_ No, nothing special. Bit knackered now though. _EOL_ Look, I didn't plan this to happen. But I'm not going to apologize for it either. _EOL_ Oh, grow up. Don't make this out as some kind of choice I've made. _EOL_ Who I sleep with has got nothing to do with any of you. _EOL_ Because of this. Look at you all. It's like I've hooked up with Jack the Ripper. _EOL_ Why is he? What has he ever done apart from try to help? _EOL_ He bent over backwards trying - and then got punched in the face for his trouble. And he still wants to be with me. If nothing else admire him for that. _EOL_ I wasn't sure. But now? Yes, too right I am. At least til you lot can start being civil to him - you're the ones with the problem here, not Jack. _EOL_ I don't care if you do or not. But it'd be nice if you trusted me. After all, I am family. _EOL_ About eight. ‚S nothing major, few drinks. Phil, he just wants everyone to get on. _EOL_ You're the one I'm not sure of. _EOL_ Well, that's a start, I suppose. _EOL_ You're late. _EOL_ Don't make me regret this. _EOL_ So what would you like? Pint? _EOL_ No, you're right. _EOL_ And how. He meant it. You don't have to believe him but what he said then was true. He wants this to work. Just trust him on that, okay? _EOL_ Morning sexy. _EOL_ Let's work up an appetite first. _EOL_ If you want to talk about me at least say it to my face. _EOL_ Based on what? _EOL_ You alright? Phil? _EOL_ Well, he's in a good mood. _EOL_ Don't worry. You'll be in Pat's by the end of the day. Trust me. _EOL_ Jack helped them. _EOL_ Nope. I think that one's all you, Billy. _EOL_ It's not really the Vic's trade we'vre targetting, Aunty Peg. _EOL_ If I don't over-charge the City lot they won't think they're having a good time! _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ You're an Eastend business woman, Aunty Peg. Why don't I leave your name at the door. Family discount on drinks! _EOL_ Roxy can look after the bar for a couple of hours. _EOL_ Who do you know who uses the phone at this hour? _EOL_ Confirmed by text. Nothing like the personal touch, eh. _EOL_ No, you can. _EOL_ Professional bar staff. _EOL_ Since that bloke asked for Sake, you came up with a couple of choice cockney expressions! _EOL_ Who said anything about you not working? I want you on cloakroom and the loos. _EOL_ And a little bit _EOL_ They're in a bit of state actually. So if you want some overtime, you know where the cleaning stuff is. Just think, at some point in the night, every bloke's gonna have to go. _EOL_ Why can't you? _EOL_ I used your idea. Inappropriate thoughts between cousins. Only I put a different spin on it. For Honey's sake. _EOL_ Not we, no. _EOL_ It got ‚em out, didn't it? _EOL_ Early start. _EOL_ If it turns out to be a disappointment, I'll be at the club. _EOL_ Bottom of the barrel in my opinion. _EOL_ Well keep ‚em coming. Trust me, I can handle it. _EOL_ Buy a girl a drink? _EOL_ Nice one, Jase. _EOL_ I didn't say a word. _EOL_ Oh look, when are you gonna get this into head, alright. I don't care, I'm not interested. _EOL_ Nothing Aunty Peg. _EOL_ I don't believe _EOL_ I don't want to talk about it, Auntie Peg. _EOL_ No, No It's nothing to do with Jack. _EOL_ It's not a fellah. _EOL_ It's our Dad. _EOL_ She knows what he's like and yet every time he whistles, she's like a puppy dog. It's all gonna end in tears and guess who'll end up shovelling the mess. ...and why is there never anything you want in this damned house! _EOL_ Sorry Auntie Peggy. I don't work here anymore, and even if I did, I wouldn't wear one of those. _EOL_ No, what I can't stand is her capacity for self-delusion. If he loves you so much, where is he now? You ain't gonna see him for another year. Or the next time he wants his ego massaging. _EOL_ That's rich coming from her! Did you see the way she was with Jack? _EOL_ I really couldn't _EOL_ Oh Tracey's ill so Peggy twisted my arm, don't worry I'll be at the club by eight on time. Talk about mutton. Three guesses who gave it to her. _EOL_ It didn't. _EOL_ I know exactly what will have happened. He'll have shown up late with some other woman in tow. Because Daddy's got his little girl a present none of us _EOL_ Mmm, I'm dreading it. _EOL_ I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. _EOL_ She's not going to like it. _EOL_ Just seizing the day. _EOL_ No, I was gonna leave my phone number on a post it note. _EOL_ Oi. _EOL_ I can't I've got loads to do. _EOL_ I said I'd help Peggy get things ready for Phil's dinner. _EOL_ You're still coming aren't you? _EOL_ I'll see you later then yeah? _EOL_ Get off, I've gotta go. I'll see you later yeah? _EOL_ You're talking to me now? _EOL_ No I'm gonna get something with Jack. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ What d'you mean? _EOL_ I do. _EOL_ Well this time it's different. It works and I'm not gonna mess it up. _EOL_ Is this yours? _EOL_ I take it not Phils? _EOL_ Who's is it then? _EOL_ Oh, oh right. It's her birthday soon is it? _EOL_ Oh, of course. _EOL_ I thought we could go together. _EOL_ No, just... Oh shut up. Come on let's go. _EOL_ Thank you. _EOL_ Yeah, I know. Come on. _EOL_ Happy birthday, Phil. _EOL_ Yeah, that's why he bought him this non alcoholic wine as well. _EOL_ This looks amazing Auntie Peg. What is it? _EOL_ Oh right. _EOL_ Neither did I. _EOL_ Phil. _EOL_ You alright? _EOL_ Phil! _EOL_ What did you do that for? _EOL_ I can't believe you just did that. Here let me clean you up. _EOL_ I think we should leave. _EOL_ I don't understand. You and Phil can't stand each other. _EOL_ It was a big thing me bringing you tonight, and yet you've been meeting up and doing secret deals? _EOL_ How did he even come to sell it to you? _EOL_ Why would you even buy it though? _EOL_ Oh, I left my make up at yours. _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ I just wanted to say- _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Everything there is to know. _EOL_ No I didn't know that, but- _EOL_ I know enough. _EOL_ Yeah, yeah she's called Selina, they're divorced and they've got a daughter. _EOL_ I trust him one hundred per cent. I'm not gonna to let some petty macho rivalry get in the way of what we've got. _EOL_ No, no Max is still out. Well don't worry, I'll just find my make up bag and then I'll be down there... No I think i left it in the bedroom... Well that's great, it's great that it's busy, it should be a good night... Oh here it is, I've found it. I've got what I came for. _EOL_ I was just gonna come over - _EOL_ I thought we needed a cooling off period, that's all. _EOL_ Look, why don't you take Albert back. And we'll go and talk about it in the caff, yeah. _EOL_ When we got back to his, we had words, okay. _EOL_ Alright. Look, bringing him over maybe wasn't one of my best decisions - _EOL_ You just can't standit, can you? You can't stand me having a shot at happiness. _EOL_ You didn't even make it that far though, _EOL_ Mitchell. Same as me. _EOL_ Roxy ain't exactly part of your fan club. Reckons I don't know enough about you. _EOL_ I dunno. Something. Anything. What is your favourite colour? _EOL_ I was just getting warmed up - _EOL_ Why don't we go out? _EOL_ How bout next Friday? _EOL_ The first. _EOL_ Better offer? _EOL_ I thought it was her birthday this Friday? _EOL_ You don't talk about her much, do you. _EOL_ I understand. Must be really painful, if your ex is restricting access... _EOL_ Tough on you. _EOL_ If you and Selina can't stand to be in the same room, why don't you take Penny away somewhere. On holiday. Kids don't need anything flash, do they. We could go camping, get a caravan - _EOL_ Hmmm? _EOL_ Sure, yeah. Why not? _EOL_ I make my own decisions. _EOL_ These the keys to your heart? _EOL_ It's just for a couple of days. _EOL_ Why're you doin' this? Why are you letting Jack come between us? _EOL_ Yeah, an' I'm supposed to be the one who sits here, waiting to pick up the pieces. Maybe I fancied a change. _EOL_ I'm not moving out, ok. It's just a couple of things. _EOL_ hey, look, why don't you come to the club, later? OK? I'm gonna be working but we can have a few drinks, a dance. Me and you. _EOL_ Yeah? A date? _EOL_ Rox... _EOL_ What I want is a large vodka. No ice. _EOL_ Roxy's gut instinct. Takes some winning over. _EOL_ Just wanted to say thanks, for the idea. Jane's very lucky having you for a brother. _EOL_ Cheers. I was rude, earlier, on the phone. I'm sorry. It's just, when I heard the message - _EOL_ Truth? He hasn't told me much. _EOL_ Jack just wants to take his daughter out on her birthday - _EOL_ He wants to be there for her, spend time with her.I mean you've got to give him credit for that at least - _EOL_ I thought she loved to dance? _EOL_ I had to leave, I wasn't feeling too good. _EOL_ Right. _EOL_ That what you promise Penny? We met. I went to see her. Well, Selina. _EOL_ Your own kid. Just across town as it happens... _EOL_ That's what Selina said. Told me to ask you. _EOL_ When was this? _EOL_ It was on Nelson's orders? _EOL_ She can't blame you... _EOL_ I'm so sorry. I should've come to you first, I should've asked you straight out. It's just I've got Roxy in one ear, I've got Phil in the other... _EOL_ I won't, I won't - _EOL_ Okay. Then we'll go out somewhere, yeah? D'you wanna go out and get something to eat? _EOL_ Jack - ? _EOL_ Don't worry, you'll get 'em back. _EOL_ What you gonna stop me? _EOL_ Who said anything's wrong? _EOL_ Just trying to sort out a few staff problems. Got to find a replacement for Cameron. Nothing's wrong, OK? _EOL_ Hi. _EOL_ I was just - _EOL_ Hi Jack, you and me are one thing, but not turning up at the club last night, that's business. _EOL_ What are you doing here? _EOL_ Meaning? _EOL_ I just need to talk to Jack about a work matter, that's all. _EOL_ What business is it of yours anyway? _EOL_ Just leave it Rox, OK- _EOL_ I said, leave it - ! _EOL_ Well, well. The elusive Mr Branning. _EOL_ We were pretty busy last night. _EOL_ Such as? _EOL_ So what is it? The event that this punter wants to talk to us about? _EOL_ What? Hip-hop? Salsa? Tea? _EOL_ Meaning? _EOL_ Yeah why don't you, I've had to run this place on my own, maybe the change will do you good - _EOL_ First impressions? _EOL_ That depends if the numbers are right. _EOL_ Sounds good. _EOL_ I didn't read any email. _EOL_ Nudists. _EOL_ Think we'd feel like spoilsports if we didn't. _EOL_ Dawn doesn't wear that much anyway. _EOL_ No he's from the North, they make them hard up there. _EOL_ No no poke around. Is this a wind-up? _EOL_ You knew about this - _EOL_ You had to - _EOL_ Unfinished business, is it? _EOL_ Away from here. _EOL_ Do I want to? _EOL_ Well I like to keep my men on their toes. _EOL_ You know I would have understood. About Penny. If you'd just been straight with me. _EOL_ No. I shouldn't. _EOL_ Right, I should be getting back. Face the music. _EOL_ Yeah. Let's just keep it between us. _EOL_ No I could just do without Roxy in my ear right now. You don't mind, do you? _EOL_ I'll make it up to you I promise. _EOL_ Did you miss me? _EOL_ Thanks very much. _EOL_ How is she? _EOL_ Don't worry. I'll smooth things over. _EOL_ Actually Auntie Peg, is it alright if I have a quick shower first. I'll talk to her later, I promise. _EOL_ Just now. _EOL_ Just away for a few days. I wanted to clear my head. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Done and dusted. _EOL_ It's OK, I - _EOL_ Black. _EOL_ Where you going? _EOL_ Oh, I dunno - _EOL_ Another time maybe. _EOL_ I know. I just fancy a quiet night in. _EOL_ I said a quiet night in. Now go on, go and terrorise the male population of London. _EOL_ It's very tempting. But I've gotta go. _EOL_ I just wanna be back before Roxy's up and about. She thinks I was snuggled up with a DVD and a bottle of Merlot last night. _EOL_ I'm not. I just want a quiet life. Look I really love my sister, but living with her does my head in. _EOL_ That an offer? _EOL_ I was joking. _EOL_ It's not the right time. _EOL_ Call it what you want, but the answer's still no. I've gotta go. I'll see you later. _EOL_ Hope I'm not disturbing you am I? Still doing the grumpy teenager act? I hope you're gonna clear this lot up. _EOL_ Have you seen my pink jumper? _EOL_ Why do you have to lie? _EOL_ Yes, you. _EOL_ yes but it's my pink jumper. _EOL_ Look it's not really about the jumper. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'TANYA': \"Another drink? _EOL_ Lightweight. Let's see what we got over here shall we? Oh look it's 21 year old whisky. Let's have that shall we? Max prefers them younger. _EOL_ That's my Seany Sean Sean. No point going to bed early on New Year's Eve is there? _EOL_ Yep. _EOL_ Well, I wanted us all to be together. _EOL_ That's a Mother's perogative. Go and get your jim-jams on- we can all watch big ben together with a tub of ice-cream. Bye. _EOL_ I don't want to hear any of your crap. Just get out of the house Max before I scream- don't think I won't. _EOL_ I said get out! _EOL_ Wants. Coming. _EOL_ ...a boxed set does not count as one choice, young lady. Yes? Speaking. I don't believe it. Okay, I'll be right there. _EOL_ We're getting dressed. Someone broke into the salon last night. _EOL_ Thanks for this, Dot. _EOL_ Bradley. _EOL_ How're you- _EOL_ Great. _EOL_ One thing: Max doesn't get to see them, okay? _EOL_ I mean, if you go out and he's... He'll try and talk to them. I don't want that. _EOL_ You're a Godsend. _EOL_ Not now. I've got to go to the salon. _EOL_ Pick your moments, don't you. _EOL_ Some other time, okay? _EOL_ Someone broke in. _EOL_ Yeah. Funny thing is, no sign of forced entry. _EOL_ Didn't have to, did they? Not when they could just walk in. Who didn't lock up last night? _EOL_ Forgot. _EOL_ Go. _EOL_ You thinking now? Any of it hitting home? _EOL_ Bit late for that. Get out. And don't bother coming back. _EOL_ You don't like it, you know what you can do. _EOL_ Cutting edge, that's me. _EOL_ Me neither. _EOL_ I've got get the kids, feed Oscar, cook their tea and there's still so much to do I don't know how I'm gonna... _EOL_ Know any Fairy Godmothers? _EOL_ Are they ready? _EOL_ You haven't fed them, have you? Because I've got plenty in the fridge-- Oh. _EOL_ I told you. _EOL_ Thanks, Dot. Big help. Got a minute? _EOL_ Door. What d'you think you're doing? _EOL_ Happy coincidence. _EOL_ You're not going to do this, Max. _EOL_ See them. Whenever you like. I won't let you. _EOL_ After what you did? By the time I've finished with you, you'll be lucky if the judge lets you see them once a year. _EOL_ What're you talking about? _EOL_ Come again? _EOL_ She got her head stuck in the railings and besides- _EOL_ What? _EOL_ ...bed now, girls. Don't make me come up. _EOL_ You're kidding. _EOL_ My hero. _EOL_ Stay. Have a drink? _EOL_ First Preeti, then Hazel. Then Dot. I thought I could rely on them, you know? But instead they... Forget it. I'm just being stupid. _EOL_ Someone to rely on. It's not that much to ask, is it? Time you were gone. _EOL_ Don't. Don't say anything you don't mean. I can't- _EOL_ That's ridiculous. _EOL_ Got a hankering for women who're past it? Bit blurry round the edges? Where everything sags a few inches lower than it should? And stretch marks. Don't forget them. It's like Clapham Junction down there. _EOL_ Some catch. Max couldn't wait to trade me in, could he? And not for the first time. Maybe it's my fault- _EOL_ Maybe if I was a bit more pert, you know. Had a bit more snap. Maybe then he wouldn't've- I can't...I just...want someone to...hold me... _EOL_ So...if you'd rather _EOL_ What're you doing? _EOL_ I mean-- _EOL_ Did the girls see you? _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ What does that mean? _EOL_ No-one can know. You realise that, don't you. _EOL_ I mean it, Sean. Our secret. I'm gonna go downstairs. Do breakfast for the girls. While they're busy arguing over the cereal, you can slip out the back, okay? _EOL_ Thank you. _EOL_ I don't know. Not expecting or pushing me to...you know... _EOL_ Gotta get breakfast sorted. _EOL_ I understand, Preeti. But I really need to talk to you. Please. In the salon? I'll see you there. _EOL_ For a bit. I'm sorry. _EOL_ Thought you might wanna watch the telly. A treat. _EOL_ Where're you going? _EOL_ I'll get it. _EOL_ I over-reacted yesterday. I'm sorry. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Like running your own place? _EOL_ I need a manager. I need you, Preeti. Give me another chance. _EOL_ Go away, Max. _EOL_ If you're looking for a fight... _EOL_ Then what're you doing here? _EOL_ I know. That's what's so funny. _EOL_ And what was yesterday, when you accused me of being an unfit mother? _EOL_ Good? _EOL_ Don't... _EOL_ Stop it. Just...stop it. True. You know me better than anyone. But it wasn't me who threw it away, Max. And you're not moving back in. _EOL_ I know him. He won't stop there. _EOL_ I can't fight him. _EOL_ I'm afraid I'm not strong enough. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Never. _EOL_ I see. Is there anything I can do to change your mind? _EOL_ ...I want them to start right away. Tomorrow. Yes, I know what time it is. You're an agency, aren't you? With people on your books? Then how about opening them? _EOL_ What? Not you. Hang on. Pellets are in the cupboard. _EOL_ Since when? _EOL_ I'll remind you of that next time we have broccoli. In the fridge. _EOL_ Sorry. Two minutes. You must have someone. _EOL_ How do fishfingers sound? _EOL_ Haven't got anything else. _EOL_ Maybe. _EOL_ I know... _EOL_ Go on then. Tell Lauren to get her things... _EOL_ She was saving it till last. Isn't that right? Abi? _EOL_ Abi always saves the barbecue dip till last. _EOL_ Abi? Is everything okay? _EOL_ Look...I know it's been _EOL_ ...but I'll make it up to you. _EOL_ Starting right now. Get your pyjamas on and we'll watch TV. Just us, all snuggly on the sofa. And I've got a replacement for Preeti and I'm on top of everything. Things're gonna calm down, okay? I promise. _EOL_ No, he's not violent - have you been listening to a word I've said?... ...so, I've just got to put up with this, have I? So what am I paying you for?... oh, just forget it! _EOL_ Yes, fine. _EOL_ Told you, I don't want to hear your voice. _EOL_ Don't care. Anything you've got to say, write it down. _EOL_ Stay out of this, please, Lauren. _EOL_ Nothing, Abi... nothing at all. _EOL_ Why are you so being so shifty? What would I find? _EOL_ Some twenty year old with her ankles round her ears, I'll bet. _EOL_ Yes, Sean... _EOL_ I know that's meant to _EOL_ I don't know what you mean. _EOL_ Sean just came round for a chat. _EOL_ A little bit... but not half as much as I'd like to... _EOL_ Clear enough, isn't it? _EOL_ Erm... Let me see... that'd be around the time you slept with your son's wife. _EOL_ Sean's got nothing to do with this. _EOL_ How d'you know he hasn't _EOL_ Girls are having their supper at Dot's tonight... _EOL_ Yeah, that's right. _EOL_ The scar... I want to see it. _EOL_ Someone shot you... _EOL_ Don't joke, Sean... seeing it like this... to think someone wanted you dead... You never talk about the army. _EOL_ Because it's painful? _EOL_ With people trying to kill you? _EOL_ But you never shot anyone, did you? _EOL_ But you didn't kill them? _EOL_ You killed someone? I can't... I mean... what does that feel like? _EOL_ No anger... no hate? _EOL_ Get out. _EOL_ Can't stop him having feelings for me - _EOL_ Don't you think this is all a bit pathetic? Girl your age mooning over her brother? _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ Oh good. You're ready. _EOL_ I told Dot you'd pick Oscar up after school. Don't mind do you? _EOL_ Toast? Cereal it is then. _EOL_ I don't believe this. _EOL_ If only.GO _EOL_ No point then, is there? _EOL_ I'm not interested in anything you've got to say. _EOL_ Give me a break. You were protecting your sister. _EOL_ Not the point. _EOL_ You reckon? _EOL_ You know what Sean? All I care about is my kids. That's the only thing that matters now. You, Max, all his tarts...you're nothing. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ I know that no man can be trusted. Whatever he says, whatever he does. I've been a bit dumb about it in the past, but I think I've got the message now. _EOL_ Tough. _EOL_ You helped me out when I needed it Sean. Warm body, someone to lean on. But I'm fine now. _EOL_ So thank you and goodbye. _EOL_ Yeah, yeah I can. _EOL_ I'm so sorry but our hairdresser's off today. If you wouldn't mind waiting another twenty minutesI'd behappy to... _EOL_ If you'd like to go through, won't be a sec. Nightmare. What did the agency say? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ This is all I need. _EOL_ Terrific. Oh well. Just have to busk it, won't we? _EOL_ Thanks. Right, stick the kettle on while I sort this lot out. _EOL_ Sorry you've had to wait. _EOL_ No time. Tell all your friends about us... ...Except the really hairy ones. What you doing here? _EOL_ Dot's. _EOL_ I've got to work. _EOL_ No! _EOL_ I don't need anything from you... I said I'll be there in a minute. No, look I'm sorry... _EOL_ Get out. _EOL_ No you won't. _EOL_ I'm closing up for the day. _EOL_ Whatever you like. _EOL_ Did I say you could talk to me? _EOL_ That right? _EOL_ Did me a favour. That's a first. _EOL_ He's a _EOL_ That's rich. A slut like you trying to give me advice. _EOL_ If you were me? You tried that once remember? _EOL_ Just want Ben. _EOL_ That's alright. I'll have a red wine while I'm waiting thanks. _EOL_ Rainey? Rainey! _EOL_ Why are you still here? _EOL_ I was drunk. _EOL_ Whatever I said... _EOL_ Yeah well, you ain't that. _EOL_ Yeah, give yourself a pat on the back. Anyway, whatever you're after, you're wasting your time. _EOL_ Really? What happened Rainey? Money I gave you run out? Couldn't find another mug to ponce off? _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ Thanks for the money. I'm sorry I... _EOL_ Don't matter. _EOL_ Everyone has their moments. _EOL_ Something like that. _EOL_ Okay. You really wanna know? He's been having it off with a girl half his age, who also happens to be his daughter-in-law. Happy now? _EOL_ Been going on for ages...right under my nose. Lied to my face Rainey. _EOL_ I trusted him and he completely betrayed me. _EOL_ Anyway...he's gone now. It's over. I'm fine. Alright. Getting there. _EOL_ And who's gonna help you? Last time you were in this kitchen I caught you shooting up. _EOL_ I'd rather you left. _EOL_ If I had a penny for every time... _EOL_ What would you know about the truth? _EOL_ Rainey... _EOL_ I've got the kids to think about. _EOL_ I've got to get to the Salon. _EOL_ No... _EOL_ Didn't I? _EOL_ Here. _EOL_ See you next month. Not again. Haven't you got anything better to do? _EOL_ Good for you. _EOL_ Fine, why? _EOL_ We're not together now. What I do is none of your business. _EOL_ Rainey. _EOL_ Dunno. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Rainey! _EOL_ Right. _EOL_ I don't trust anyone. _EOL_ You don't know the half of it. _EOL_ Alright, that's enough disco practice. School. _EOL_ Close enough. You'll wake Oscar up. Come on. Move. _EOL_ No, it didn't. _EOL_ And got punished for it too - Because hitting people isn't right. _EOL_ Go on. Go and get educated. Properly. Bye love. _EOL_ Rainey? Thanks. _EOL_ That sound like a screwed up drug addict to you? Rainey, Derek Evans, social services. Max has told them you leave syringes everywhere and invite my kids to shoot up. _EOL_ I know. And so does Max. He's just stirring up trouble for the divorce hearing so he can fight me for custody - you must realize that. _EOL_ You see? Do you honestly think I'd let her anywhere near my kids if I didn't trust her - one hundred per cent? _EOL_ I prefer Ms Cross now, thank you. Or Tanya. Don't call me Branning. _EOL_ Talk away. Excuse me. I'm going to see to my son. _EOL_ Ex-addict. _EOL_ You're the one with a drink in your hand. _EOL_ What's wrong? _EOL_ Oi. Homework first. You can plan your social life later. _EOL_ Oh yes, I love being bad cop. _EOL_ No. Although you know what would really settle it? If you took another drug test. _EOL_ Tomorrow. ‚S just a few minutes at the clinic. Get them to send the result over to social services, prove you're clean. _EOL_ Yes, but you weren't living with me then. I want to send it to Max's lawyer. Stop any chance of him using it. You don't mind, do you? For me, Rainey. And the kids. Please? _EOL_ Thank you. _EOL_ Have you got your swimming kit? _EOL_ Not today, no. She's got a doctor's appointment - I expect you'll see her later. _EOL_ Be safe. Good luck. _EOL_ No, you deserve a lie in - they'll be fine on their own. What time's your test? _EOL_ And how long til they get the result? _EOL_ Well, don't forget to ask them to send it on to social services. That guy yesterday, Derek Evans, he'll be expecting it. _EOL_ I know. Rainey, this isn't about you. It's about Max. _EOL_ Hello? Speaking. Its about the drug tests results yes? And? And what does that mean? No, for me. And my kids, the court case, what does that... I see. Right. Yes, I will. Thank you. Bye. _EOL_ You said you were clean. _EOL_ Marijuana is a drug, Rainey - you lied to me. _EOL_ Well, let's hear it for the class B drug addict. Congratulations on your down grade. _EOL_ He also said I should consult my solicitor. Which means there is a risk. _EOL_ You think Max's lawyer isn't going to use this? Try and turn it into something more substantial? _EOL_ They're so worried she'll slip, your honour, she has to be tested every week, that's how much faith her own sister has in her. I'm sorry, but I'm not taking any chance that jeopardizes me keeping my kids. _EOL_ You said, you'd go! If there was a risk. You just promised. So, what was that? Just you lying to me again, yes? _EOL_ Rainey, wait. Look, why not stay til they get back? We can explain it together. _EOL_ Of course you will be. _EOL_ Rainey, stop - I'm not shutting you out. You're still a part of this family. _EOL_ It's just temporary, that's all. You've been amazing. _EOL_ What's that supposed to mean? _EOL_ No. Don't you dare slip back now. Don't you prove to me I was right to make you leave. You've got to prove to me that I'm wrong. _EOL_ Rainey's gone. I've told her to leave. _EOL_ No. No visits either. You'll have to find some other way to make me look like an unfit mother. _EOL_ Abi'll be hurt the most. Lauren too, they really liked her. It's your children you're damaging. Again. _EOL_ Yes, you love that lie, don't you Max? ‚My kids mean more to me than anything' - except a quick romp with Stacey, of course. _EOL_ Why is it? You knew what you were risking. Your marriage. Your children's happiness, peace of mind - but you did it anyway. _EOL_ But you don't regret it. That's the thing. You don't regret Stacey. All you regret, Max, is getting found out. _EOL_ You did it, because you thought you'd get away with it. And deep down, you still do. You think one day I'll forgive you and then you can go back to playing the family man. Until the next girl comes along, of course. Which is why it won't happen. Not ever. Cos I'd hate to think how old that next girl would've been. _EOL_ Oh hello Dot. I didn't know you worked mornings. _EOL_ Well, I was gonna come round and see you anyway. Thought the house might be feeling a bit empty what with Jim still at the nursing home... _EOL_ Wish someone would answer mine, I tell ya. Oscar never settles. I hardly ever see the girls anymore. And now I'm short staffed at the salon. Can't cope with much more. _EOL_ I hope you're right. I really do. _EOL_ Alright, yes. What's her name again, Dot? Clare Bates... Has she worked in a salon before? Well I can't really help her then can I? Oscar please come on... Alright. Alright. yes I'll see her but only cos it's you...Send her round about four. Hello. I'm afraid we're fully booked. _EOL_ I'm sorry. I've made up my mind. _EOL_ I've got enough on my plate without taking a risk on her.... _EOL_ Right, I've been asked to see you both as a favour. But seeing as I haven't got much time - I thought it would make sense to interview you together. Excuse me girls. Yes Mo. _EOL_ We're fully booked. _EOL_ Not at all. _EOL_ Infact to show there's no bad feeling. I've got a couple of trainees here who need to consolidate their experience. I could offer you that at considerable discount if you're interested? _EOL_ I'm so sorry Mo... _EOL_ I think I've seen enough. Leave them to it shall we, Clare? _EOL_ I couldn't give it to Clare could I? _EOL_ No it's okay, It's fine... _EOL_ yes... if you don't mind. Could you take a message, tell 'em I'll call them back. Thank you. _EOL_ Morning girls. _EOL_ Gaynor will show you.Clare - Gaynor, Gaynore - Clare. _EOL_ You did. _EOL_ She really helped me out on reception yesterday. And what with Hazel needing time off, make sense to give her a go. _EOL_ I'll be back later in case there's any problems. But until then. I'm sure you'll both make her very welcome. _EOL_ Oh hello, I was just coming to find you. How's everything going, alright? _EOL_ Oh...right. Thanks for telling me. _EOL_ Have a nice long lunch did you? _EOL_ Only Clare was telling me how she'd asked you to help her sort things out. _EOL_ Well next time I'd put the Salon before a gossipy chat with your mates or you won't have a job to come back to. _EOL_ And for your information - far from messing things up this morning - Clare has done a fantastic job. _EOL_ In fact I'm so impressed I'm making her my assistant manager. So I suggest you show her a little bit more respect from now on. And it seems to me a little bit of team building is in order, so we're gonna stay and have a meeting after work. And if things don't improve after that I'll be forced to think again. Do you understand Chelsea? _EOL_ You sure you don't mind? _EOL_ Right then well look. I've only just fed and changed him so he should be alright. But there's a bottle made up in the fridge if he does need it. And um, well, I'll only be a couple of hours. _EOL_ No, I'll be right back. _EOL_ Help yourself to tea and coffee won't ya? _EOL_ Well, I've got my mobile. _EOL_ Gotcha. _EOL_ Sweetheart... _EOL_ I'm Celebrating. _EOL_ Yeah it's the first one. It's on Valentine's Day. But this year Cupid's going to take his arrows back... _EOL_ There's no other way to go Lauren. What your Dad did to me, us, there's no coming back from that. _EOL_ It's more of a new start. That's how I'm looking at it. _EOL_ Lauren... _EOL_ Long time ago now eh? _EOL_ Hello sweetheart what you doing up? _EOL_ Oh, sorry, I didn't realise. Is Oscar awake? _EOL_ OK... _EOL_ You do that. And Abi... _EOL_ I Love you. _EOL_ Ssh What the hell are you doing?? I've got kids asleep upstairs! _EOL_ Who? _EOL_ How dare you come barging in my house like this. _EOL_ As if he's going to be round here! _EOL_ I told you he's not here!! _EOL_ A) I don't know and B) I don't care. Now get the hell out of my house before I call the police. _EOL_ I want you to leave. _EOL_ Why are you really here Sean? _EOL_ Could at least tell me the choices. Maybe I could help. _EOL_ Wasted journey. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Don't tempt me. _EOL_ You hit someone? _EOL_ That's some temper. _EOL_ Who's they? _EOL_ Who is this Sean? _EOL_ Yeah... _EOL_ Thought you just said you hit him? _EOL_ Right... _EOL_ Why are you telling me all this Sean? _EOL_ Don't? _EOL_ You know exactly what you're doing. _EOL_ Don't take me for a fool...Sean, I've heard enough lies to last me a lifetime. _EOL_ I don't believe you. _EOL_ Because that's the sort of man I attract. Men who'll say anything to just get what they want from me. _EOL_ Oh wake up Sean. You're as bad as Max. _EOL_ It's not my problem. _EOL_ Well you don't look well. _EOL_ I'm going to nip over the minute mart, get you some cough mixture. Lauren, Lauren, can you keep an eye on Abi and Oscar for me please. _EOL_ Don't open the door to anyone will you. _EOL_ I'm just nipping to the Minute Mart I won't be a minute. _EOL_ Idiot. _EOL_ As if I wasn't already in a hurry and now I've got to go and buy more cough mixture. _EOL_ Abi. But don't worry about that. _EOL_ It's just a cough. _EOL_ Look Max I haven't got time for this. _EOL_ If you think I'm letting the girls anywhere near you--- _EOL_ No I will sort something out with work alright. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Max, I've heard enough of your lies to last--- _EOL_ Well she's safe and sound now, where she belongs. _EOL_ Tough. Cos when you closed me out of your life, you closed them out an all. _EOL_ Neither was sleeping with your daughter-in-law. _EOL_ Yeah well let's hope she's learned her lesson eh. _EOL_ Sorry Sean I haven't got time. _EOL_ Yeah, well... Some things best forgotten in't they? _EOL_ You know you could always get some help, talk to someone. _EOL_ You'll be alright. You got this far in't you. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'SEAN': \"No. I'm pretty wasted as it goes. _EOL_ In for a penny. _EOL_ Tanya? _EOL_ Come on. I don't want to leave things like last night. _EOL_ I just thought-- _EOL_ What's so important? Got a vital meeting? Left the heated curlers on overnight? _EOL_ There're some designers who'd charge a fortune to come up with this look. _EOL_ I'm sorry about earlier. I wasn't thinking. _EOL_ Someone had fun. _EOL_ Need some help? _EOL_ Leave me the keys, see what I can magic up. _EOL_ Everything back to normal. _EOL_ Like nothing ever happened. Pretty much. _EOL_ Anyway. I'll see you tomorrow. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Tanya... _EOL_ You're all I want. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ You're beautiful. _EOL_ Don't be stupid. _EOL_ I know. _EOL_ I'm not going anywhere. _EOL_ What does it look like? _EOL_ He was hungry. I didn't want to wake you. _EOL_ Course not. _EOL_ Good appetite. What my Mum would call a proper little Trencherman. _EOL_ I've no idea. _EOL_ If you like. _EOL_ For what? _EOL_ Still don't get it, do you? _EOL_ Seat's taken. _EOL_ I'll think of someone. _EOL_ From you? _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ Think you know it all, don't you? _EOL_ Worried, are we? _EOL_ You think? _EOL_ Sure of that? _EOL_ You mean, the place you've been locked out of? _EOL_ What can he do? You've changed the locks. _EOL_ Sure you can. _EOL_ Look at me. You gonna let him take your house? _EOL_ You gonna let him take the kids? _EOL_ He gonna make a fool of you again? _EOL_ You're strong enough. _EOL_ Got to take this, Stace - _EOL_ I'm not saying you can't come round the flat - _EOL_ It's a mess. _EOL_ You know I'm only attracted to older women. Have I ever told you how much I fancy you? _EOL_ Nah, I'm pretty stupid too. _EOL_ The biscuits. _EOL_ Did you know he washere? _EOL_ So, are you using me? _EOL_ Is that right? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ You got a kinky side I should know about? _EOL_ I was wondering what that was. _EOL_ Not much to say. _EOL_ Painful? Nah. I liked it. The world made sense. _EOL_ That's the job... You have a pop at them, they have a pop at you. _EOL_ Yes, I did. _EOL_ You get shot in the head with an SA80, it's gonna sting a bit. _EOL_ It felt like... I dunno... it felt straightforward... like I was doing my job... it felt like nothing. _EOL_ Nothing. And that's good, ‚cause if you're going to kill someone, it's best if you're dead too. Inside. And that's what I was. For years. Dead. But now? I'm breathing again... _EOL_ Have I? I dunno, battery, maybe.... _EOL_ What? _EOL_ ‚Course - what is this? _EOL_ Well, you still got me. C'mere... _EOL_ Tan - _EOL_ Five minutes... _EOL_ Don't shoot me down okay? _EOL_ I know what you think... _EOL_ Wait. _EOL_ I don't care. I'm gonna say it anyway. _EOL_ I didn't want to hurt you okay? That's the only reason I didn't come straight to you... _EOL_ No. I had it out with her. Stacey swore it'd finished with Max ages before the wedding... It's true. I know Stace. _EOL_ So I made a big mistake.... _EOL_ Look I thought it was best all round. Honestly. You can't punish me for that... _EOL_ It's different. We're different. _EOL_ You know how I feel. _EOL_ I care about you. _EOL_ You don't mean that. _EOL_ Tanya... _EOL_ Still wearing that lovely ankle bracelet courtesy of Her Majesty? _EOL_ Ahhh, all on your own? No mummy to look after you now? _EOL_ So when's the party starting? Well, you know, me and Deano, we go way back, gotta make sure I'm here for him. _EOL_ We'll see about that, won't we? _EOL_ Hey. There's no trouble here, Peggy. Just here for a nice quiet beer. Promise. _EOL_ I was gonna tell Deano no hard feelings. _EOL_ That's it, I'm gonna kill him. _EOL_ You need to get your front door fixed. Where's Deano? _EOL_ Gone? Alright, well where's he gone and when's he back? _EOL_ He's run away again has he? _EOL_ Right so how about I batter you instead? _EOL_ You tell him, if he ever comes back, I'm going to do that to him my arms get tired. _EOL_ Like I'd notice the difference. _EOL_ Nothing. Look, I just want to have a nice quiet drink please. Alone. _EOL_ Oh no . Lucky her. _EOL_ Why? Cos you asked me to? _EOL_ Stacey... Stacey, can you hear me? _EOL_ I'm not stepping anywhere. _EOL_ I dunno... One minute she's sitting there , having a few drinks, next minute she's on the floor... _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Why's she staring at me like that? _EOL_ Look at her eyes look like they're made of glass. C'mon that's not right. _EOL_ ---No! She didn't! Now stop her staring at me like that. Stacey. Stace... Where are you taking her? _EOL_ What do you mean a ventilator? All she did was fall over. _EOL_ How bad is this? _EOL_ Yeah, I'm her brother. _EOL_ What's going on here. What's happening? _EOL_ Just get her right, can you do that? _EOL_ Is she awake? _EOL_ Well get back in there and do your job. _EOL_ She didn't take anything. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ I'm all she needs. _EOL_ C'mon! You stupid thing.... What? You got a problem eh? _EOL_ Sorry... I Sean... _EOL_ What are you lot doing here? _EOL_ That's one way of putting it. _EOL_ Dunno. _EOL_ I don't know. _EOL_ What you gonna do? You a doctor? _EOL_ You can't. _EOL_ To do what? Dribble all over her? _EOL_ ---Grapes!? Just do us a favour stay out of it eh mum. _EOL_ For once in your useless life will you just pull yourself together. Last thing Stacey needs is you carrying on in it? _EOL_ I don't know Charlie we were in the club and she just keeled over. _EOL_ Look I don't know how many other ways I can say it Mo I don't know? _EOL_ Have you got ears Charlie?! _EOL_ Back off, you ain't helping! _EOL_ You know what if _EOL_ Use your head will you! If she did take something it's cos he pushed her to do it. _EOL_ You know what I'm out of here. _EOL_ You're always scared. I want to know the minute you hear something. Think you can do that? _EOL_ No choice. I've got to make things right. _EOL_ I dunno. Whatever it takes. _EOL_ Max! Open up! Max. Get out here! Get out here! Branning. _EOL_ I'm going to kill you! You hear me!! You're dead!! _EOL_ Come on out you coward! C'MON!! _EOL_ MAX!! _EOL_ Oi Open up! _EOL_ Let me in! _EOL_ Is he here? _EOL_ Who do you think! _EOL_ Max!! _EOL_ Max!! _EOL_ He ain't at Jack's he's got to be somewhere. _EOL_ Where is he!? _EOL_ Ain't going to happen. _EOL_ Still deciding. _EOL_ Maybe I'm here for you. _EOL_ I was wondering when you were going to get round to it.I mean I even drained the bottle so you wouldn't spill any. Do it. _EOL_ I won't try and stop you. Kill me. _EOL_ C'mon! C'mon one hit should do it right to the temple. In some cases a blow to the head is as good as a knife or a bullet. I should know. _EOL_ Didn't have much choice. Didn't appreciate being lied to. _EOL_ They tried to _EOL_ I did a Stacey,night after night,getting off my head, as much as I could stomach... Then oned day he starts up, has a right old pop. I tried so hard to block it out. But he kept on and on and on at me. Getting louder and louder. And I just crack. and I lash out. Hard. Fast. bam! Next day he's gone. Next day he's gone forever. _EOL_ Who? _EOL_ He was my dad. I killed my dad... _EOL_ My dad was a builder. He worked up on the scaffolding. And his friends they told me that he went all pale his legs turned to jelly and all of a sudden he fell. _EOL_ It was me that caused the fall. Delayed reaction. My fault. Now every time I look in a mirror I see him. His anger...Looking back at me. Accusing me. So there it is. That's me. _EOL_ Right? Is that all you can say? _EOL_ I want you to know why I left Stacey. Why she turned out the way she has. You're the only person who would understand. You're all I want. _EOL_ What...? _EOL_ What d'you mean? _EOL_ I tell you the truth. _EOL_ Why would I lie? _EOL_ That's not me. _EOL_ So where am I supposed to go now? _EOL_ Well? _EOL_ What d'you think? How's Stacy? _EOL_ We going to start this again are we? _EOL_ Which is why I'm here now innit. _EOL_ Must've been pretty bad then. _EOL_ Stacey's alright. Just let you know she's okay. _EOL_ Doubt if she'll be taking any pills --- _EOL_ Hang on. I just wanna say I'm sorry. _EOL_ Wish I could. _EOL_ They'd probably just lock me up. _EOL_ And you? _EOL_ You alright? _EOL_ Good. Good. But the day you're not, you know where I am. _EOL_ Your old man's out in the square. _EOL_ It's alright, steady. He ain't coming this way. Be interesting if he was though, eh. _EOL_ What did you see in him anyway? I mean tell me honestly, alright, if you meet him for the first time now, what would you think? _EOL_ Will I see you later? _EOL_ Oi I been looking all over for you. You said you were gonna call. _EOL_ Like drinking yourself to death? _EOL_ Don't think I don't know what was going through your head the other day. _EOL_ When you called me. Said you ‚wanted me'. You ‚needed me'. _EOL_ So I don't like being used. _EOL_ I was being polite. _EOL_ If that's what I wanted Tanya, I could've paid for it. I wanted YOU. Only I didn't GET you did I. _EOL_ Well find some other mug to make an idiot of. _EOL_ Well I did. _EOL_ Yeah well, you didn't need me yesterday, did ya. _EOL_ What's the point? _EOL_ Do you have any idea how long I wanted you? How much I wanted you? And now i got you, I'm just wondering ‚what that was all about?' _EOL_ Well quite frankly, I feel a little bit used. And not in a good way. _EOL_ Oh come on, Tanya. You're there but you're not there, are ya. Let's not pretend, eh. _EOL_ yeah well I want all of you. I'm not getting all of you. _EOL_ I think you're scared. _EOL_ Well then convince me. _EOL_ It was gonna be breakfast in bed. What are you doing up? _EOL_ No, well I wanted to. Happy Birthday.

But I, I had to get you something didn't I? _EOL_ Here you are. _EOL_ Why not? _EOL_ It's her birthday. She's allowed to enjoy herself, ain't she? Tanya, look take it easy, yeah? _EOL_ No I don't think that's a good idea. _EOL_ Jane's right. Maybe you should go to bed yeah? _EOL_ Everybody's watching you. What about the kids? _EOL_ I seem to remember I was a bit busy holding you up at the time. Anyway, what was I gonna do? He's their Dad. I'm just some bloke who lives down the street. And what about your performance last night? Are we gonna talk about that, or just pretend that didn't happen either? I mean one minute your fine, the next minute old Maxie turns up and you're all over the place. _EOL_ Still pushing your buttons? _EOL_ If you're worried about keeping up appearances, I wouldn't bother. _EOL_ Are you having a laugh? After last night, half the square knows by now. _EOL_ Are you that ashamed to be seen with me are you? Oi! I asked you a question. _EOL_ Tanya? You alright? _EOL_ Yeah, well. When is? I'm sorry I didn't answer your call the other day I was in the middle of something... _EOL_ Nah. It's what do you want? I mean we're on, we're off. We're getting somewhere, we ain't. I mean where are we going Tanya? _EOL_ Alright, lunch. I'll cook us up something. I can boil an egg. _EOL_ I'll take you somewhere. You, the girls, Oscar. _EOL_ No he wouldn't. _EOL_ I'm not having it. Alright? You just having to take whatever he dishes out, in your face the whole the time... _EOL_ Right then. I'll have a word. I'll tell him to... _EOL_ Tanya just tell me. What do I need to do? What can I do? _EOL_ Tanya..? _EOL_ So... we're sorted yeah? _EOL_ I'll see you later. _EOL_ You're just giving in to him now in't ya? You can't let him get to you Tanya... _EOL_ Did it go alright? _EOL_ Ok. _EOL_ Who was that? _EOL_ Something wrong? _EOL_ Yeah course I will... If Max can't be bothered. _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ I'm sure I'll be fine. _EOL_ You always this nervous on parents evening? _EOL_ Yeah but you're making ‚em sound like category ‚A' prisoners. _EOL_ Look I've got your number. If there's any problems. I'll call. _EOL_ How'd it go? _EOL_ Had to change Oscar. Ye-es. Girls are in bed. Dinner's in the oven. Thought you'd run off with the geography teacher or something. _EOL_ Right. _EOL_ Yeah well, that's Max for you. Day they put him in the ground, he'll walk his way out of it. _EOL_ What reasons? YOu know the minute he's back through that door, he'll be back to his old self. All the lying, all the cheating. And what am I? What am I to you? Just disposable? _EOL_ Alright then, why? Why you doing it? _EOL_ Yeah, I know. She sneezed. _EOL_ Marge? Do you need a tissue? She said Abi, stop worrying. _EOL_ Well you know Dr Dolittle, me. _EOL_ Said I was sleeping on the couch. _EOL_ I don't think she believed me. _EOL_ Couldn't sleep. _EOL_ I don't care whether your little plan works or not. It's makes no difference to me. _EOL_ I just don't want him living here. Alright? _EOL_ You and him, here. All nice and cosy. _EOL_ When you move him back in. You gonna move him back into your bed, are you? _EOL_ Sorry Tanya. You do this, you're on your own. _EOL_ No actually I'm here to stay. _EOL_ She isn't been complaining about what I've been giving her. _EOL_ Really. Do you even know what she wants, mate? _EOL_ Tanya. Nothing's changed. _EOL_ So he swallowed the bait then, has he? _EOL_ Well. Hook line and sinker. Well done you. _EOL_ So you just expect me to sit by while that piece of scum runs his hands all over you. Is that it? Sorry Tan. Like I said. I can't do it. _EOL_ Wouldn't I? _EOL_ What am I playing at? _EOL_ You take him back, I'll have him gloating in my face. _EOL_ And what about when he tries to crawl back into your bed eh? What you gonna do? Have a headache? For how long? _EOL_ Tanya. We don't need his money. He's losing you. The kids. Come on. Isn't that enough? _EOL_ I don't care if he does. We can manage. Let's just go, now. _EOL_ Your house? _EOL_ Don't do this. _EOL_ Yeah. I'll hear that from her, thanks. _EOL_ You'll what? _EOL_ So you've made up your mind then? _EOL_ I get no choice in it? _EOL_ Nothing I say is gonna change your mind, is it. _EOL_ Fine. If that's the way you want it... _EOL_ He deserves whatever's coming to him. _EOL_ So when does Max move back in? _EOL_ Today? _EOL_ Just don't need it dragging on, do I. _EOL_ I'll call alright. _EOL_ Visiting. _EOL_ What, you think I'm lying, do you? _EOL_ Well what's not to believe? _EOL_ D'you think I like any of this Stace? _EOL_ Maybe I don't want to Max to have the satisfaction of seeing he got to me? _EOL_ Just forget it Stace. She's made her choice. Ain't our problem now. _EOL_ What is all this then? _EOL_ Careful, Stace, remember where your last set of secrets got you. _EOL_ Doing what? _EOL_ So it's your turn to sneak about is it? Meet up in hotels, make sure we don't get caught. _EOL_ You do realise you're going to have to sit with him, talk to him. Laugh at his jokes with the kids. You've gotta make him think that everything is back to normal. You have to feel his breath on your neck knowing what you want to do to him. You have to let him back in your bed Tan. _EOL_ You're gonna enjoy this aren't you, getting revenge? _EOL_ Hey, you alright? I just popped in to wish you luck. _EOL_ Yeah, when aren't I? _EOL_ You er, you really wanna get on this course thing don't you? _EOL_ You get a chance to escape, don't miss it. _EOL_ No, no I'm not. _EOL_ Nope, I think Mr Potato Head's working on his own today. _EOL_ So, er, we won't be seeing your designs in the local supermarket then? _EOL_ Oh well, it would have meant working with a bunch of lentil munchers anyway. _EOL_ OK. Cool but it's you I want. _EOL_ Is he keeping to the agreement? _EOL_ And then we're out of here, yeah? _EOL_ Well why, I thought you said they were gonna be out for ages. _EOL_ What's this? _EOL_ Yeah, I know that. But what's it doing here? _EOL_ Well what if I don't _EOL_ Are you taking the Mick? _EOL_ Was gonna ask you the same thing. _EOL_ Yeah I know, you Max, happy families, I heard it all- _EOL_ Yeah, how's his back by the way? I mean I've told some whoppers in my time but I mean- _EOL_ Promise me...? _EOL_ I know it's early but I just..just wanted tohear your voice...remind me whatI'm missing. _EOL_ Come to the window. Hello. _EOL_ Right now, I should belying next to you, feeling yourskin and thinking how beautiful you look in the morning. _EOL_ No, gorgeous. Like you ain't got a care in the world. _EOL_ Well, I can think of a few ways to help you forget them. _EOL_ You shouldn't leave this place empty. _EOL_ Why d'you hang up on me earlier? _EOL_ Get out of your drinks later. Come and spend some time with me. _EOL_ Can't? Or you won't? _EOL_ I know what Max is like. He does his Jungle Book eyes on people and they fall under his spell. _EOL_ Yeah? _EOL_ I'm just sounding a note of warning, that's all. I mean, what we talked about is all very well but I wonder if you've got the stomach for the fallout. _EOL_ No, I think that's your problem. Steven Beale's on his way over. _EOL_ No, course not. I'm going to nip out. Give you love birds some privacy. You alright, stalker. She's in there. _EOL_ Tanya, he's playing you, all over again - why can't you see that? _EOL_ Oh, wake up - _EOL_ If that was true he would have already done it, wouldn't he. Look he's got everything he wants. He's back here, he's got his home, his family - _EOL_ Just kick him out. I don't need Max's money, all I need is for us to be together. _EOL_ Well how long's that gonna take? A week? A month? Years? _EOL_ Eh. So how did it go last night? The papers - to control Max's money. Did he signed them or what? _EOL_ Hey. Hey that's great. How did you convince him? Tanya, tell me you didn't. _EOL_ Tanya. Tell me you didn't sleep with him, please. _EOL_ Your mum's been on the phone. Apparently you have to go home. It's past your bedtime. _EOL_ I know. I've been trying to talk to you all day. Don't worry about a thing, alright. Everything's sorted. I've got the flights booked, we're all checked in. I've got champagne on ice for after we take off tomorrow. We're out of here, we're out of here in style. Don't stress alright. _EOL_ I've been on the internet all day. I've found this great school for the girls. They're gonna love it, we all will. _EOL_ I knew he'd get out of this. _EOL_ This doesn't change anything - we've got the tickets, let's just go. _EOL_ I don't know. We'll work it out. Come on please. _EOL_ I won't let him. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ I'm thinking, she's had a night's sleep, maybe she's calmed down a bit. _EOL_ Alright then, so tell me what you're thinking? _EOL_ Have you any idea how mad this is? _EOL_ No, you haven't. _EOL_ Tanya, no matter how bad it gets, no matter how much you want Max gone, you won't do it. You ain't got it in ya. _EOL_ Okay. So, Max is dead, Lauren and Abi are in pieces, the police are all over you, and we start playing happy families? _EOL_ Oh, Tanya, we'd never be free of it. It's a dream. _EOL_ What do you want from me? _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'ROXY': 'What is he doing here? _EOL_ Surprised you have to ask. _EOL_ I\\'m not going to spell it out for you. _EOL_ You really know how to treat a girl right, don\\'t you, Jase? New year\\'s eve- No text, no call, no plan. _EOL_ Is that how we\\'re doing things now? Telepathy? I thought you might\\'ve served me up something a bit posher than a fish supper. Obviously you didn\\'t pick that up on your radar. _EOL_ Do you know what, you\\'re skating on thin ice, Dyer. That\\'s all I\\'m saying on the subject. _EOL_ Hello? I got your text. Phil\\'s let me knock off early. Oh, oh now, you see, now this is more like it... _EOL_ Where is Jase? _EOL_ But he texted me. _EOL_ Oi! Come to apologise have you? Well it\\'s too late, cause there\\'s someone else on the scene. _EOL_ Come on then _EOL_ What is your problem? _EOL_ Miss 99p Knickers over here thinks she\\'s the only bird in the club. _EOL_ Don\\'t blame me! Jase get off me. _EOL_ Jase, you are chucked from here to Timbuktu. _EOL_ Oh, did I screw everything up? _EOL_ Oh, I\\'m over him already. Clean slate for the New Year. What about you? _EOL_ Go back if you like. I\\'m alright. _EOL_ Midnight and I\\'ve got no-one to kiss. _EOL_ You can\\'t do the catering for the funeral. _EOL_ Just to hack off Ian? _EOL_ You\\'re sick as a dog. I heard you last night. You got any insides left? _EOL_ How was I to know those prawns were dodgy? _EOL_ I said I\\'m sorry. _EOL_ Never trust prawns. They _EOL_ You can\\'t do it on your own. _EOL_ I\\'d do egg mayonnaise and all. You\\'ll probably need to boil about 25 eggs, mash them up with some mayo... Or you could stick with the ham. _EOL_ Upstairs. _EOL_ She\\'s...busy. _EOL_ Really busy. _EOL_ I can give her a message. _EOL_ Something about an 18th? _EOL_ Whoa, there, not so fast. _EOL_ You don\\'t want him to see you like this. _EOL_ Me? _EOL_ Ah. _EOL_ Isn\\'t this awkward. _EOL_ Shame to let it go to waste. Now I\\'m here. Like I said...I know what\\'s what. _EOL_ So it\\'s true then? About Louise? _EOL_ How\\'s that work then? _EOL_ I knew it! Ron was worried that he was going to snatch her but he\\'s paid her off, hasn\\'t he? _EOL_ Well, if it ain\\'t Walford\\'s very own Bloodhound... _EOL_ He popped out. _EOL_ We don\\'t know exactly, but thanks to you, Ronnie reckons we may have one more for breakfast... _EOL_ Who\\'s side are you on? _EOL_ Ron. Jack\\'s driving a wedge between this family. If you can\\'t see it, it\\'s only ‚cos you don\\'t want to. _EOL_ See? He\\'s got you brainwashed. _EOL_ Better than being deluded. GO _EOL_ Ah this is so sweet. _EOL_ Maybe Honey could use ‚em eh? Put ‚em away for Janet. Aunt Peg? _EOL_ Come here. _EOL_ Can I help you? _EOL_ He\\'s having his tea. _EOL_ Shirley? _EOL_ Well done Keith. You should leave her alone. _EOL_ Unfaithful husbands have that affect on women, didn\\'t you know? _EOL_ You\\'re a Branning ain\\'t you? Wouldn\\'t trust you as far as I could throw you. _EOL_ No, go ahead. _EOL_ No. Albert. Albert, come back. Albert. _EOL_ Albert? Albert, where are you? Albert. Here boy. _EOL_ She\\'s in the loo. Shhh, will you? _EOL_ I\\'m trying to get Albert. He sneaked in. Well, help me look for him then. _EOL_ Well, she ain\\'t going to think that. We\\'re cousins. _EOL_ Eugh. Is that what you think about? _EOL_ That\\'s disgusting. _EOL_ You left the door open - Albert\\'s in here somewhere. _EOL_ Well, he must\\'ve gone out again. I just got a bit worried. You know, with the kids. _EOL_ How Ronnie can sleep through this racket beats me. ‚S like being in a zoo. Oh, don\\'t bring that in here, I\\'m eating my breakfast. _EOL_ Eh? _EOL_ Oh right. Yes. Anything that helps that. _EOL_ Yes, well, you don\\'t have sordid sexual fantasies about Peggy, do you? Or do you? _EOL_ Where are you? I\\'ve just been in your room, I thought you were still asleep. _EOL_ Oh right. Good night, was it? _EOL_ I bet. Jack\\'s not the lightest person to lie under, is he? _EOL_ Not even worth that, are we? _EOL_ So why lie about it? _EOL_ You think he helped Phil with Louise? _EOL_ So are you two an item then? Are you going to keep seeing him? _EOL_ No, she likes him, definitely. _EOL_ He\\'s a bloke, isn\\'t he? You tell me. _EOL_ Yes, that\\'s really kind of her. _EOL_ Yes, more room, then we wouldn\\'t stand in your way. _EOL_ Whatever. _EOL_ Oh, get over yourself, this ain\\'t about you and Jack. _EOL_ She wants to stay with us cos she thinks that\\'s what we want. _EOL_ Well, she ain\\'t exactly playing with a full deck, is she? No offence. _EOL_ Nicer than you, that\\'s for sure. Billy thinks about having sex with us. Tell Honey that she\\'d move out. _EOL_ Cousins can still do it, he said. Told me it wasn\\'t illegal. You know, in case it was that holding us back. Yes, right. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ There is no way I\\'m sharing with you. I\\'m going to talk to Peggy. _EOL_ It\\'s not happening, I tell you. I am not sharing that box room with Ronnie - I just can\\'t. _EOL_ No, you don\\'t understand. I\\'d go mad. I\\'d kill her. I\\'d kill all of you, I know I would - _EOL_ We\\'re celebrating Billy\\'s new place. He\\'s moved in already. _EOL_ I still don\\'t get why Honey changed her mind. It was a bit freaky really. She just came in, starting hugging me, saying she was going. She is safe, isn\\'t she? You know, mentally. _EOL_ I\\'ve never said anything about a shower. Have you? _EOL_ What are you looking at? _EOL_ Yeah. Fantastic innit, not having to wade through stinking nappies? Although I will miss Billy you know. Such an easy target. _EOL_ Don\\'t know. Don\\'t care. _EOL_ Brilliant! _EOL_ Roxy\\'s going out. Boat trip. Dinner. Dancing. My call apparently! _EOL_ Oh look I don\\'t get to see him that often. And when I do, he always goes over the top. _EOL_ Go on, after you. _EOL_ Come on then Billy. Let\\'s get fruity. _EOL_ Lemons. Limes. For the pub. _EOL_ So I hope you\\'re not missing us too much? ‚Didn\\'t even see you over the weekend for a drink. _EOL_ yeah well I suppose we did get a little bit ﬁon top of each otherﬂ, didn\\'t we. _EOL_ You won\\'t see me anyway. Coz I\\'ll be out. _EOL_ With a man. _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ This is Janet\\'s. Can you drop it in with Honey and Billy? _EOL_ Because they\\'re being really weird with me. Why did they move out? _EOL_ What? That we fancied Billy? _EOL_ You\\'re _EOL_ You are lucky I\\'m off out to have a skin-full of very expensive wine tonight. _EOL_ yeah well, we\\'re making a day and night of it. There\\'s always so much to catch up on. _EOL_ It won\\'t be. _EOL_ He\\'s worth it. _EOL_ Don\\'t start! _EOL_ You don\\'t have to. I could see it all over your face. _EOL_ You are just jealous, Ronnie, and it\\'s pathetic. _EOL_ I don\\'t like it. Covers up my USP. _EOL_ My unique selling point. I feel de-sexualised, Auntie Peg. _EOL_ I don\\'t think so. _EOL_ Under extreme duress. _EOL_ No way. _EOL_ Why do I have to make the first move? _EOL_ You didn\\'t hear some of the things she said about Dad. _EOL_ What?! _EOL_ I\\'m not saying he\\'s perfect, alright. But he\\'s still my Dad and I love him. And because I love him, he _EOL_ What is your problem? I\\'m not asking you to go. You see, Aunty Peggy - she\\'s just jealous. _EOL_ Why don\\'t you just tell her, Ronnie? _EOL_ Well that\\'s gotta come from Ronnie. But you\\'re gonna have a very long wait, Aunty Peg. _EOL_ That\\'s two eighty please. _EOL_ If she\\'s happy with my cast-offs... _EOL_ She spent the night at Jack\\'s. _EOL_ It\\'s not me you should be _EOL_ Yes, Peggy. _EOL_ In the dusters bag. _EOL_ I\\'m actually wearing a brand new top but I\\'d wait forever before anyone round here said anything. _EOL_ Oh er, are we still going halves on Phil\\'s present? _EOL_ Well I\\'ve seen a couple of things and I thought if... _EOL_ Oh okay. _EOL_ What is this? _EOL_ This is not you. This is not how you are with blokes. What sharing presents, staying over, inviting him to family _EOL_ No you don\\'t. You\\'re suspicious, you don\\'t let blokes into your life. You don\\'t trust them. _EOL_ Aren\\'t you? _EOL_ Did you know? _EOL_ Right, well I\\'ll just take all this lot down shall I? _EOL_ Oh here we go. You know Phil doesn\\'t drink. _EOL_ Ugh is it? _EOL_ I\\'m not so sure I want to eat a deer. _EOL_ And are these um... _EOL_ Creep. _EOL_ There\\'s no need to shout at him. _EOL_ Oh Albert no! _EOL_ I\\'ll go. _EOL_ yeah? Remember where we live? _EOL_ Least we know where your loyalties lie. You\\'ve made that very clear. _EOL_ Why? Too scared to face Aunty Peg? _EOL_ Took you long enough. _EOL_ Finally swapped that frog of a\\' husband of yours. For a charming Prince. _EOL_ That the way you and Jack get your kicks, is it? Set a bomb, stand back, watch fur fly? _EOL_ Before falling into bed for the weekend. _EOL_ Jack sat there and he waited and he waited, an\\' he chose his moment. An\\' if you can\\'t see that - _EOL_ Hello? You\\'re his way to getting close to Phil. You\\'re a piece of skirt, notch on his bed post. End of. _EOL_ You think this is for real? You\\'re kiddin\\' yourself. You don\\'t know who he is, you don\\'t know what he\\'s about, Ron. You don\\'t know anything about him! _EOL_ Sexy. _EOL_ Don\\'t suppose you fancy goin\\' out sometime? Let me show you around. _EOL_ Well there\\'s the local. Or the club, R&R. Which my sister, who I\\'m not talking to, runs. Go there if you want? _EOL_ Bet I\\'m more fun. _EOL_ For now... _EOL_ See you found your way back, then? Are you moving out? _EOL_ You do know you\\'re making the biggest mistake of your life? _EOL_ Cos I\\'m the one supposed to sleep with dodgy blokes. I\\'m the one supposed to believe all the guff they give. _EOL_ I don\\'t want you getting hurt. _EOL_ I\\'m supposed to be coming down anyway. Some bloke I\\'ve met. _EOL_ No...I don\\'t know... He wants the VIP lounge anyway. I said I\\'d do it as a favour. _EOL_ Don\\'t panic alright, he\\'s got something else planned.... Word gets out, should be a nice little earner. _EOL_ Right, all sorted. Expect fireworks... Look. If he\\'s what you really want - _EOL_ She got any idea? _EOL_ Love to, but I\\'m supposed to be getting rotten with my sister. _EOL_ Where d\\'you get him from? _EOL_ Yeah - I knew that. _EOL_ Come out, you said. Let\\'s spend some time together. _EOL_ What\\'s so bad you couldn\\'t come and tell me? You take me for granted, Ronnie and you always have. You wouldn\\'t do this to a mate. It\\'s like the time you swapped my Vanilla Ice CD for Whitney flamin\\' - _EOL_ What\\'s wrong? _EOL_ Your face for starters. _EOL_ And that\\'s why you slept here last night is it, instead of over at your boyfriend\\'s, ‚cos everything\\'s hunky-dory? I told you it would end in tears. _EOL_ What\\'s he doing down there? _EOL_ Typical. First time I hear that in weeks from a bloke and he\\'s a ginger. _EOL_ What do you think this is, Scotch mist? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ I was just about to ask you the same thing. _EOL_ It\\'s a bit desperate isn\\'t it? Hunting him down. Listening to his messages. _EOL_ Well he obviously doesn\\'t want to see you. _EOL_ Why are you so bothered, that\\'s what I don\\'t get, you\\'re always going on about how much you don\\'t care about him. _EOL_ What happened to that old Ronnie Mitchell pride? Alright, so he\\'s off bedding some tart, so what? _EOL_ Don\\'t push me. _EOL_ Oh, Ron, Ron, Oh Ron - I\\'m sorry - Ron. _EOL_ Yeah, it was Ron\\'s. _EOL_ She didn\\'t. _EOL_ It\\'s her favourite. It means the world to her. _EOL_ It wasn\\'t an accident. _EOL_ Is that all ... _EOL_ ... she said? _EOL_ Did she say where? _EOL_ Well good job I got this sorted then won\\'t it. _EOL_ Ron - _EOL_ Yes. Of course. Her mobile\\'s off. _EOL_ Lining up the next unlucky victim already are you? _EOL_ Nice time Friday night? _EOL_ I saw you. Oh got your attention now? That\\'s right, I saw you and your ﬁnot so exﬂ wife. _EOL_ You gonna tell me she was just giving you a hand polishing the office desk? Game over, Jack. Because when Ronnie gets back, I\\'m gonna tell her exactly what I saw. _EOL_ I will. _EOL_ It\\'ll make me feel a bit better. And it might just wipe that smug grin off your face for once. And that is the point. _EOL_ You busy? _EOL_ I need your help with something. _EOL_ But don\\'t you think she\\'s got a right to know? _EOL_ On? _EOL_ Why are you always so...right. _EOL_ Only if you do something for me. _EOL_ No. But it might be immoral. _EOL_ You and me. Up town tonight. Get ratted. Take my mind off things. _EOL_ ...Oh let\\'s go there. _EOL_ Oh come on, it\\'ll be great. I\\'ll even let you be the master\".\" _EOL_ Yeah, i\\'m sorry about earlier Aunty Peg. _EOL_ When did you get back? _EOL_ Right. Where did you go? _EOL_ Of that loser I hope. _EOL_ So you haven\\'t seen him? _EOL_ So it\\'s over? _EOL_ Sis. Look I\\'m sorry about what I said... _EOL_ No, it\\'s your life I shouldn\\'t have interfered. I\\'ve got something for you. I had it fixed. Turn around. _EOL_ I knew you\\'d figure out what a low life Jack is. Even if it did take you a while to get there. _EOL_ What do you reckon - blue or black? _EOL_ See, what would I do without you. _EOL_ A few drinks here then out clubbing with Christian. Why don\\'t you come with us? _EOL_ Oh go on, it\\'ll be great. Me and you out on the pull. I miss those days. _EOL_ Oh come on, it\\'ll be fun. _EOL_ I can stay in with you if you like. _EOL_ Alright. And I\\'ll pull a bloke for you while I\\'m at it. And if you\\'re really lucky, I may even bring him back for you. _EOL_ Sis It\\'s good to have you back. _EOL_ I hope you\\'ve got your dancing shoes on, coz I am in the mood to party. _EOL_ Well, you were right. As usual. _EOL_ I thought it was four. _EOL_ Him, him I can understand. Narrow eyed little weasel. He\\'d shag a lamp post if he bumped in to it. But Ronnie. Why would she lie to me? Why would she do that? _EOL_ I\\'m gonna go over there right now, I\\'m gonna tell her everything. _EOL_ Well that was obviously before she had a lobotomy and let that cheating rat talk his way back into her knickers. _EOL_ So what am I supposed to do? Keep shtoom while he gets his cheating hands all over my sister? _EOL_ Fine. Then I\\'ll have it out with ferret features. And you\\'re not gonna talk me out of it this time. _EOL_ The point is I saw you with Ronnie when I told you to stay away from her. _EOL_ What? And you didn\\'t have the heart to turn her away? And I suppose it was her idea to lie about the two aswell was it? _EOL_ Yeah, right. _EOL_ Maybe I will. And maybe I\\'ll tell her about you and Selena aswell. _EOL_ I\\'d rather I did it than you did. Which you will do. Eventually. _EOL_ That is not true. You cheated on her. _EOL_ Yes mum. _EOL_ No. Oh, there it is. _EOL_ Me? _EOL_ It\\'s only a jumper. _EOL_ Well if it means that much to you. _EOL_ Well make your mind up. _EOL_ Why don\\'t you? _EOL_ Forget something have we? Apart from your brain. Well don\\'t let me stop you. _EOL_ Let me guess. Drop dead? _EOL_ I\\'d watch it if I was you, Phil. You\\'re outnumbered here. _EOL_ I\\'m making you something to eat... _EOL_ Well where are you going? _EOL_ I can always count on you for support. _EOL_ I\\'ve come for Ronnie\\'s things. _EOL_ Not if it means running into you no. _EOL_ Yeah well that\\'s funny. ‚Cos I could\\'ve sworn I walked in on you straddling her. _EOL_ You\\'re damn right it was. _EOL_ You ain\\'t good enough for her. _EOL_ Isn\\'t it? _EOL_ Oh, I\\'d get on the blower to your solicitor if I were you. Because... ...She wants out. _EOL_ What\\'re you looking at? _EOL_ Nothing I ain\\'t heard before. Blokes like him, Ron. They ain\\'t worth crying over. Look. I\\'ll tell you what I\\'m gonna do. _EOL_ I\\'m gonna run you a bath... Alright ... and then we\\'re gonna put your face on, and I\\'m gonna find you the tartiest outfit you\\'ve got... _EOL_ Ron. If you don\\'t do this for me... do it for yourself. Yeah? ‚Cos I hate to say it... But you stink. _EOL_ Well, I\\'d be married to Damian. Wondering what the hell went wrong with my life. You saved me from that. _EOL_ I always need you, Ron. _EOL_ Bagsy not being Sal. _EOL_ So, what we gonna do tonight eh? _EOL_ Sounds like a winner. _EOL_ Yeah? _EOL_ Just goes to show. You\\'re never too old... _EOL_ It\\'s my day off. Thought I\\'d go shopping. Why? _EOL_ Poor you. Well good luck with that! _EOL_ They\\'re gonna want party games you idiot! Not some psychedelic rave! _EOL_ You ain\\'t got a clue have you? _EOL_ Alright. You\\'re on. Anything to stop that self-satisfied creep getting one over on you. Get in. _EOL_ No. Never better. _EOL_ Better things to do. Oh and she wanted me to tell you good luck with the new opening hours too. _EOL_ Yeah, we like a bit of healthy competition, you know, keep us on our toes. _EOL_ You really fancy yourself, don\\'t you. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ She doesn\\'t give a damn about you. _EOL_ Oh and he wants his keys back. _EOL_ Stuff Phil - you know what we should do? _EOL_ But this is like a challenge. _EOL_ Where you going? _EOL_ Arrested? What for? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ In my bag. _EOL_ You said if Phil did it, you\\'d be proud. _EOL_ How long you gonna keep this up? This is really childish. You should be thanking me, Ron, I did this for you! _EOL_ And now he\\'s out! _EOL_ Phil\\'s been in the nick more times than Pete Doherty, he can handle it. _EOL_ They would\\'ve been already. It\\'s obvious they\\'ve hit a dead end. _EOL_ Oh nice one. _EOL_ What me? _EOL_ Alright, yeah. I\\'ll see what I can do. _EOL_ Bit desperate ain\\'t she? _EOL_ Essential maintenance work. Well it\\'s not easy looking this gorgeous, is it? _EOL_ How? _EOL_ Well what\\'s he gonna do? _EOL_ Oh alright, lighten up yeah? It\\'s over. We won. And Tanya Branning\\'s having a party tonight. D\\'you fancy it? _EOL_ Do you ever have one of those days where everything just falls into place? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Yeah? Well, you\\'ll be waiting a long time then won\\'t you? Because guess what? I\\'m not sorry. In fact, I\\'d do it again. _EOL_ What you doing? Ow! Let me out of these things right now or I swear to you, I will scream. Get off me. Somebody help me, help. What the hell are you doing? Let me out. _EOL_ Where the hell are we going? You ain\\'t a copper anymore alright? You can\\'t arrest me. _EOL_ Somebody help me! _EOL_ Ow. What do you want? _EOL_ Forget it. _EOL_ Where are you going? I don\\'t know where I am! You can\\'t just leave me here. Alright. I\\'m sorry alright! There, I said it. Jack! Jack. Don\\'t leave me here please! Jack! _EOL_ Hiya, I can\\'t answer the phone right now, but if you\\'re lucky, I might call you back! _EOL_ Ask your psycho Ex. _EOL_ He just kept driving and driving. And for a minute I thought he was... And then, he, he just dumped me in the middle of nowhere; miles away. Pitch black. No money, no phone, no nothing. I just hitched all the way back. Hitched and walked. _EOL_ He would. He\\'s cracked. I saw it in his eyes. He could have done... anything. _EOL_ I\\'m too wound up to sleep. _EOL_ The only thing that will make me feel better, is to watch Jack Branning suffer. _EOL_ I\\'m gonna pay Jack a little visit. _EOL_ Why\\'s it always gotta be about you? You weren\\'t there and you don\\'t know what he put me through. _EOL_ I know what I\\'m doing! _EOL_ What do you mean? _EOL_ No Ron, come on, it\\'s the last thing I feel like doing. _EOL_ Are you\\'re kidding? _EOL_ How long have I got to pack? _EOL_ Have I got time for a leg wax? _EOL_ I love you! _EOL_ You get the money? _EOL_ Yeah. As if! _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Yeah ok. _EOL_ What are they all looking at? _EOL_ Oi, you call this a party? Come on, who wants some? _EOL_ This, this is all the way from Austria.

It\\'s about a grumpy old man who falls for a girl who just wants to have fun. _EOL_ Yeah, yeah not exactly like Shirley. And um, why ain\\'t she working anyway? _EOL_ Er, hanging by the phone. _EOL_ Oi, there\\'s laws against nicking punters!

You're nicked. _EOL_ Call the old bill. _EOL_ He was nicking your car. _EOL_ Is this like one of those Candid Camera things? _EOL_ He ain't worth it Shirl. _EOL_ Surprised it wasn't a brick. Why did you let her think you were loaded? _EOL_ No argument there. Talk about asking for trouble. You were bound to get caught out. _EOL_ Really? _EOL_ So why didn't you? _EOL_ You should be telling Shirl this, not me. _EOL_ Be worth it if she listened. _EOL_ She didn't say no. _EOL_ He'll fall in love with you all over again. Ow. _EOL_ Nearly quarter past eight. _EOL_ Oh. Didn't see you there. _EOL_ It's just the Bridesmaid, me in this case, and the Best Man, Garry in this case, usually follow the Bride and Groom, Hazel and Minty, onto the dance-floor. _EOL_ This is Garry. _EOL_ I'll do you a swap. _EOL_ It's no trouble. We've gotta look our best at all times, Garry. For the competition. I've spent a fortune lately on looking good. _EOL_ Hasn't your Mum said? We're through to the final stage. ﬁDesign your dream weddingﬂ. The pressure's really on. We were all supposed to put our thinking caps on over the weekend. Come up with a theme. _EOL_ That's awful. _EOL_ Yeah...? _EOL_ Have you seen it? _EOL_ A fairy-tale theme. Why didn't I come up with that? _EOL_ No it's not. We're gonna come up with unbeatable theme. This is war. _EOL_ You're not having this one. I saw it first. It's mine. _EOL_ Understated. Classic but simple. Not tacky like that double-D Donna and pansy Paul. _EOL_ Of course somebody like Posh or Sienna they'd just wear the jacket over black stockings... _EOL_ It's about making a dream come true, Garry. Your Mum and Minty's. _EOL_ Mine. You know it was. _EOL_ I've gotta get _EOL_ What's this about, Hazel? _EOL_ Yes! Of course! You're a genius Hazel - it's perfect! _EOL_ You're not gonna let that stop you. _EOL_ I mean think of the money. _EOL_ He might. _EOL_ I'm not even sure he likes dancing. In fact I've heard him say. _EOL_ You're his fiancee - did you not know ? _EOL_ Maybe we should ask your son. _EOL_ What's that when it's at home? _EOL_ This is a good one - hear her out. _EOL_ You'd make a great Dracula, Minty. _EOL_ I'll get you a cloth. _EOL_ You know what you should have done there, Minty? _EOL_ Sunk your fangs into him. _EOL_ Hi ya. Surprise! _EOL_ We need to see if these are your size. _EOL_ It's the final touch, Minty. Please - for us? _EOL_ Yeah we're depending on you. _EOL_ Which is where you come in. _EOL_ Hello Garry. Minty. About this wedding Minty. _EOL_ Hazel's got it in her head that ... _EOL_ Hazel's right. _EOL_ I wouldn't normally ask. But I've got a crisis of the nuptial variety. _EOL_ Thanks Dot. _EOL_ You made me jump! Minty in there? _EOL_ Everything is alright? With the wedding an' everything? _EOL_ Sorry? Were you speaking? _EOL_ Said I'd meet Shirl here. _EOL_ ‚S gonna be difficult... _EOL_ Pina Colada? With one of them little umbrellas? Lovely Garry. _EOL_ He's found it!? Why? What you up to? _EOL_ Pistachio's nice. Or flamingo. So much to choose from. What d'you think? _EOL_ But he hasn't! _EOL_ You don't know what he's up to. If he's up to.... Which he isn't. Cos he wouldn't, would he? _EOL_ Mummy's always said. If men don't like something, they're like grease stains. Stubborn. _EOL_ No! You can't! Not looking like that. _EOL_ Tired. Run down. Why don't you get your head down for a few hours? See how you feel after? _EOL_ Least you can walk away with your head held high. Show him what he's missing. _EOL_ She's really upset, she thinks you don't love her no more - _EOL_ All she knows, is you're being distant and moody. _EOL_ An' Dot's budgie escaped, she's ever so upset, so I had to do her shift, that's why I'm late - _EOL_ You're still going? Why? What did he say? _EOL_ Minty. When he came over? _EOL_ Sticking a needle in your eye. Do you think it hurts? _EOL_ I know! I know what Minty's up to! Minty, it's Hev. Yeah, she's here. An' you two better meet up. Quick! He wants to meet, at the Arches. _EOL_ The Vic. She'll come to the Vic. Yeah. I'll make sure she does. _EOL_ Oh. Ta. _EOL_ Sorry - I've been practising my lassooing. I know it's not very good right now but I will be, honest Minty, I won't let you down. I keep seeing it in me head. The best man, the first dance, leading out the bridesmaid - _EOL_ Wouldn't look good on video would it, she goes to lassoo him, and ends up lassooing the wedding cake or throttling a waiter. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ I don't mind. _EOL_ Which is going to be the best day of your lives - - and mine. _EOL_ They're for Hazel and Minty. They'll set their costumes off a treat. _EOL_ They're worth every penny. If they help me get closer to Garry. _EOL_ I'll take them over to Hazel and Minty's now, before my shift at the launderette. _EOL_ Ooh, Hazel. _EOL_ Hazel. You alright? _EOL_ It just did. _EOL_ The world's just ended. _EOL_ Hazel's decided she doesn't want me as a bridesmaid any more. _EOL_ And that's not the worst of it. _EOL_ No. They want Dawn to do it instead. _EOL_ And you know what that means, don't ya... _EOL_ I'm sorry. I have to go. _EOL_ Why does everything always go wrong for me Shirl? _EOL_ What is it they say? Always the bridesmaid. I'm not even good enough to be that now. _EOL_ ...But I really don't wanna make a fuss Shirl. _EOL_ But Shirl, you don't understand - _EOL_ ...None taken Shirl... _EOL_ Hazel, are you alright? _EOL_ I'm calling Minty. _EOL_ But - _EOL_ Here you go. I've brought you a fresh flannel. And the kettle's on. _EOL_ Shirley! _EOL_ No. I can't abandon Hazel. Not in her hour of need. _EOL_ I'm sorry about Shirley. She get's a bit carried away. _EOL_ It's OK. I understand. _EOL_ Shirley tells me that all the time. _EOL_ And that's the most important thing. _EOL_ Yeah, yeah ‚course I will. As long as you tell Minty. _EOL_ But that was before. This is serious. You fainted Hazel. You have to tell him. _EOL_ I won't. I promise. _EOL_ Can I help you? It's just strictly speaking, only employees of Mr Papadopoulos can go out the back. Heather Trott. Deputy assistant manageress. _EOL_ She ain't in today. She's off visiting Jim. _EOL_ We're the most popular laundry establishment in Walford. _EOL_ Are you a friend of hers? Mrs Branning, I mean. _EOL_ What did you say your name was again? _EOL_ ... Spice up your life. Every boy and every girl: Spice up your life. People of the world: Spice up your life. Ahhhhhh, slam it to the - Oh! _EOL_ She hates my music. Says it gives her a migraine. You ain't gonna tell her, are ya? _EOL_ What are you looking at me like that for? _EOL_ Like you want something. _EOL_ Why? Oh don't tell me. I hate secrets. I get all flustered and end up saying something I shouldn't. I'm best off not knowing. _EOL_ Well I knock off in a bit. _EOL_ Right. _EOL_ What for? _EOL_ Done with what? _EOL_ No no, but we're nearly at the bit where Johnny tells Baby's dad not to put Baby in the corner. _EOL_ Then I'll come with you. Ere, we can get some chips on the way. _EOL_ How do you mean? _EOL_ You're my second best friend. _EOL_ So I like spending time with you. You know if I didn't know you better, Hazel, I'd think you was trying to get rid of me. Come on. _EOL_ Told Shirl I'd get us tickets for The Spice Girls reunion. We'd missed out first time round ‚cos of me mum's sciatica. _EOL_ Oh, it's probably just the wrong number. _EOL_ I ain't. _EOL_ I dunno! _EOL_ He's in the Vic! But it's supposed to be a surprise! _EOL_ I told you I can't do secrets. _EOL_ Bit early for you isn't it? _EOL_ It's your hormones. They're bound to be all over the place. _EOL_ Rubbish! You've got a whole new life to look forward to. _EOL_ Come on. I'll get you another. Sounds like you need it. _EOL_ Pssstt! Garry! Over here! _EOL_ It's your mum. She's in a right state. _EOL_ It's this baby thing. It's started her thinking she's a waste of space. That Minty's better off without her. _EOL_ I'm really worried. Never seen her like this. _EOL_ You're so clever.... _EOL_ Course I did. Just like you said. _EOL_ Can't let the competition slide can we? What about your line dancing? _EOL_ No no, please Minty. She'll be here in a minute. _EOL_ She feels she's letting you down cos she can't make you a daddy. Getting it all out of proportion. _EOL_ Do you like George, Minty? _EOL_ There they are. Come on up. Told you there was nothing to worry about. George is always right.. ﬁYou've got to have faithﬂ.. _EOL_ She's upset about the baby that's all... Her head's all over the place.... _EOL_ But she can't just go. What about the wedding? _EOL_ Just making sure he doesn't catch a chill that's all _EOL_ Where's he supposed to go? Minty hates him now. _EOL_ But it's the photo shoot tonight. We'll have to get Hazel back. _EOL_ No. Garry might've given up on her. But I haven't. I'm not letting Hazel spoil our big day. _EOL_ Hazel. It's Heather. I know you're upset. But I'm sure we can sort it all out if you just come home.... And don't forget it's the photo shoot tonight. I know you won't let us down. _EOL_ Thought you might be hungry. Made an extra round. _EOL_ No Minty then. _EOL_ Don't suppose you've heard from your mum.. _EOL_ But we can't let our dreams of being Best Man and Bridesmaid fade into the sunset? _EOL_ Yeah... Course... _EOL_ Pay no attention. You can always share my room. _EOL_ Come on. Let's get this lot cleared up. I'll _EOL_ No... Don't say that. _EOL_ What d'you mean? _EOL_ No... A problem shared is a problem halved. Get it off your chest and you'll feel much better. _EOL_ I'm sure you were. Whatever it was. _EOL_ So she still loves him? _EOL_ Minty'll come round. And in the mean time..I'm here. _EOL_ I like Top Gear. _EOL_ If Hazel still loves him odds are she'll come walking back in any _EOL_ Just trying to keep positive Garry. Heather Trott never gives up hope. _EOL_ Hazel...stop this now...we know you still love him really....so come home please... Garry's really upset ... And the magazine's gonna be here any minute... We're all counting on you. _EOL_ Let me in. Please. It's freezing out here. _EOL_ But there's more to it Minty. You don't understand... _EOL_ Let them in. There's still a chance Hazel might come back. Just keep them talking. _EOL_ So sorry to keep you all waiting. But that is the Bride's prerogative after all! I'm Hazel. Hazel Hobbs. Very pleased to meet you. _EOL_ He could've waited til I got up. Said goodbye. It's cos of me, ain't it? I messed it all up. _EOL_ It's the same as with Minty. I spoil everything - I thought he was gonna to explode when I said I was Hazel. _EOL_ Yeah, chucked me out afterwards, as soon as she left, told me to stop interfering - oh, that's gorgeous. Thanks. You not having any? _EOL_ I should take up smoking. I might lose a bit of weight. _EOL_ Ah, you're always looking out for me, ain't you Shirl? You're my best mate, d'you know that? _EOL_ I'd keep out of your way. I could just kip on the sofa, I wouldn't mind. _EOL_ Don't send me back to my Mum's Shirl. _EOL_ Yes, but why do I have to go - _EOL_ Well, now I feel really selfish. _EOL_ Well I... _EOL_ She still loves you, Minty. _EOL_ You can't give up on her yet. Not while there's still a chance. _EOL_ Of course. Why wouldn't she? She just doesn't think she's worth it, that's all. You've got to prove to her that she is. _EOL_ By going and finding her again. It's your destiny Minty. Even Garry knows that. _EOL_ He said I couldn't move in. _EOL_ Yes, but - _EOL_ Yeah. Good luck. _EOL_ Is there anythingfunny about what I'm wearing? It's just that everyone out there seems to be staring at me. _EOL_ Seen what? Wow, I never thought it would come out that well. Here Mints. You seen it? You don't half look handsome. _EOL_ No, we look fine. We look great. _EOL_ Maybe she won't tell them. _EOL_ I'm not giving up. Not now we've come this far. _EOL_ I'm gonna ring the magazine. _EOL_ I see... No, you can't fake being in love. No, I can see Donna was never gonna keep it secret for long. _EOL_ It was bound to come out. I'm sorry. Yeah, of course you feel let down. I'll tell Minty. _EOL_ It ain't over. _EOL_ Donna's only gone and done a bunk with her fiance's brother. _EOL_ I was trying to get Donna's phone number. But she's not taking calls. Seeing as they've legged it to Greece. We're still in. _EOL_ No. They're bumping up the couple from the last round who got knocked out. _EOL_ It's gonna be like living on death row. Never knowing when the phonecall's gonna come to say... _EOL_ But my mouth's gone all dry. _EOL_ They're cheddar flavour. They're all gonna think this is stupid. _EOL_ Hello. Hello. Hello.. _EOL_ You've all seen the magazine. Me and Minty, we're engaged, like. We aren't really getting married. Well, we are getting married. Like, you know legally and that. But we ain't getting married. Not properly. Though we are sort of. _EOL_ It ain't like that. We ain't doing it for nothing like that. That's why we're in the magazine. See Minty still _EOL_ Shirl, it's a bit early ain't it? _EOL_ Come on, home. I'll just get my stuff from the launderette. _EOL_ I did try but she just kept saying get out. I've never seen her drink so much. She didn't know what she was saying. Maybe she just needs a day off, something's upset her. _EOL_ Perhaps I should give her a call. I ain't ever seen her like that. _EOL_ She shouldn't be on her own should she? _EOL_ It's the dress. it's the bridesmaid dress. _EOL_ Shirley's going to love it. _EOL_ This coming today, it's a sign. _EOL_ When she sees this dress it's going to really cheer her up. _EOL_ So it's 7 in the Vic and then a curry? _EOL_ I like mucking about. It'll be a laugh. See you later. _EOL_ Shirley? Shirl. Shirl? Wake up. Shirley. _EOL_ I thought you were dead. _EOL_ You were like.... I wanted to see if you was alright. _EOL_ I got me old keys. _EOL_ I'll get you a towel? _EOL_ 'ere. Guess what's in the box? _EOL_ Isn't it brilliant? _EOL_ I couldn't believe it when I found it. It's just like the one I wore to Aunty Bridie's party. It was the only party dress mummy ever bought me. Everybody said I looked lovely. Uncle Ken said I was the prettiest girl there. I didn't really want to get the hat, cos it doesn't really go but because of the competition and everything... What do you think? _EOL_ Come on, try it on. _EOL_ You'll look gorgeous. Come on. Put it on. I want to take a photo. Show Minty. _EOL_ It's going to be a great wedding. _EOL_ I'm not fake. _EOL_ You could wear a hair band, if you like, instead of the hat. I wore a yellow one with a daisy on it. I better go. _EOL_ When later? _EOL_ Ain't you had enough? _EOL_ I do. _EOL_ The thing is I can't. I've got to do something. _EOL_ I'm... I'm sorting things out for the wedding. _EOL_ Don't you think you should have a quiet night in, you know, get to bed early. _EOL_ I'll leave the dress here, maybe later... _EOL_ Phil. _EOL_ You could talk to her, she listens to you. _EOL_ But you get on with her. _EOL_ But she's gone all funny. _EOL_ This is different. Something's up. _EOL_ I might give Shirley a call, check she's okay. _EOL_ She's not ugly. _EOL_ I don't. Why you saying such horrible things? _EOL_ How do you know that. She's my best friend and she would do anything for anyone. _EOL_ Shirley is worth you lot put together. She's kind, she's considerate. _EOL_ You leave her alone, she's my best friend. Me and Shirl, we're like, we're like, like two people, you know like... _EOL_ No. _EOL_ No stop it. We're like... _EOL_ No. We're like Thelma and Louise. _EOL_ Shirl? _EOL_ Why did you have to ruin it? _EOL_ It was supposed to be special and you've ruined it. _EOL_ I stuck up for you. _EOL_ Why are you doing this? _EOL_ I don't know what is wrong Shirl but if you just say you want me to come with you, I will. You just have to say. _EOL_ This ain't right, I shouldn't have left her. I've gotta see if she's alright.GARRY/ _EOL_ How can I play games after what I done to Shirley? I feel like a traitor or something. _EOL_ Last time I played that was with Shirley- It was when I was ill. She'd let me win I reckon. She was good like that. _EOL_ I did it! I am the champion - I am the champion. _EOL_ I did do the right thing didn't I? About Shirley. I can win on my own. _EOL_ Next one, come on next one. _EOL_ Kerplunk! _EOL_ Shirley's phone's gone straight onto voicemail, it was ringing before. _EOL_ She's probably still too angry to talk to me. _EOL_ Its been on my mind all night. We're mates and I turned my back on her. _EOL_ Not sure me and Shirl will be making up so easily this time. _EOL_ ...I should've known something was wrong when you didn't answer your phone. Are you sure you're alright ‚cause you're really quiet. _EOL_ Only you hear these stories about people getting post traumatic stress days later. Why don't you put your feet up, aand I'll look after you. I'll get you something to eat? _EOL_ I'm only trying to help. _EOL_ I was worried about you. _EOL_ But I'm here now. I thought near death experiences changed people for the better. _EOL_ I tried talking to her but she didn't wanna know. _EOL_ She's not as tough as everyone thinks. She needed me and I let her down, and all because of this stupid competition. _EOL_ Oh. Not today Minty, I can't. It doesn't seem right with Shirley not talking to me. She was supposed to my bridesmaid. _EOL_ Minty! Darling? Is everything alright? _EOL_ ...can't stand cabbage or is it broccoli?...His favourite football team is Arsenal.. _EOL_ I'm never gonna remember all this stuff, there's just too much. _EOL_ None? _EOL_ When he was ten he had two pet mice called Skitt and Hyde. He thought they were both boys until he came home one day and found twenty mice crawling in his bedroom! _EOL_ Thanks Shirl. I never could've done it without you. I'm really glad you moved in. _EOL_ What's so funny? _EOL_ You are mean Shirley Carter. They'll smell rotten in a couple of days. I'm really sorry about the other night, I should never 've left you. _EOL_ Maybe not, but after all the stupid things I've done, you've never let me down. It's funny, sometimes I think we're meant to be mates. _EOL_ I mean, what if there are some people you're just destined to be mates with? Or things that are gonna happen to you, no matter what? _EOL_ No, I'm not saying that, but take today. Maybe you were supposed to get kicked out and turn up just when you did. _EOL_ But it worked out in the end. What if that's just life? Maybe no matter how hard you try some things are just fate. All this revising's thirsty work. Tell you what, we've got some gin in the kitchen, hoiw about I make us a cocktail? _EOL_ I've been so scatty this morning. I must've had six teas already. _EOL_ Come on, Shirl. Ask us some more questions. _EOL_ E Type Jag. _EOL_ Yes. _EOL_ His bum. _EOL_ Oh come on. Don't go all X Factor on us. _EOL_ I don't believe it! We won! _EOL_ Where's she gone? _EOL_ Morning all, we're going to the caff, get a fry-up, are you in? What's wrong? _EOL_ She's still writing to you though, that's a good sign. _EOL_ Means he's in her thoughts. _EOL_ Well, not necessarily. What if she's sending him a message? _EOL_ Yes, look. It's a boat isn't it? What if that's the ship Hazel's working on? What if she's saying ‚here I am, come and get me.' _EOL_ That's what I would have done though. If I'd been her. I'd be waiting on the dock right now, hoping you knew how much I loved you. _EOL_ Except go to the Caribbean obviously. You don't want to meet up with you know who. _EOL_ Oh, that's so romantic. _EOL_ We've got twenty grand coming from the wedding magazine. _EOL_ There's no harm is asking though, is there? _EOL_ What's she saying? _EOL_ Mum. What are you doing here? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Course I do mummy. _EOL_ Can't mummy stay a bit longer? _EOL_ You said I'd never get married. I thought you'd be pleased. _EOL_ I've settled in really well mummy, the Square feels like home now. And that's where I work. Very responsible job washing people's smalls. And Mrs Branning's ever so friendly, everyone is. Walford's lovely. _EOL_ People are really nice to me around here. _EOL_ Mummy's homeless - she's got nowhere else to go. _EOL_ Mummy you can't go home, you've been evicted. _EOL_ Do you want me to help you look for her? _EOL_ Shirley, that's out of order. You take that back. _EOL_ I know she's difficult and I know she's demanding, but you don't have to worry about it. I'll do it all. I'll cope with everything. I'm used to it. _EOL_ Yeah, but she doesn't want ... I can't tell her to go. _EOL_ No. No. Mummy would never hurt me. Well not, not physically. Well, sometimes physically, but that isn't it. It's something else. _EOL_ Well, I suppose she's sort of blackmailing us. If Mummy doesn't get her cut of the £2000, then she's gonna grass us to the magazine. _EOL_ No, Minty. Please don't. _EOL_ You took Pretty?! _EOL_ Before Mummy came, I was going to say, you should have all the spending money for the wedding. _EOL_ \",\n",

What is it, vodka? _EOL_ No lectures. _EOL_ You know I'd give anything to change...what _EOL_ You know that. _EOL_ I'd never do that. _EOL_ You have to believe me. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ I didn't mean... _EOL_ Come on- _EOL_ Bradley... _EOL_ Now you're being stupid. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ It's about Bradley. _EOL_ What I've done, the pain I've caused...there's no excuse. _EOL_ But my family is everything to me. I love them. They're mine. I'll make it right, I swear to God. _EOL_ I'm there already. _EOL_ Hey, gorgeous. _EOL_ Dot? _EOL_ Tan. _EOL_ I didn't know they were here, if that's what you mean. _EOL_ As it happens. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ You can't stop me. _EOL_ You wanna go down that road? _EOL_ You start getting the courts involved, I'll have to draw their attention to what an unfit mother you are. _EOL_ How you're obsessed with your career. _EOL_ How Abi nearly suffered a crippling injury because you were so busy opening your little shop. _EOL_ Negligence. Just like it was negligence that almost killed our unborn child. _EOL_ You had to have an ambulance. Because you preferred to go to work. And I've got lots more. You're an unfit mother, a dangerous liability and you won't take my kids from me. _EOL_ They use these things in Guantanamo? _EOL_ You enjoying this? _EOL_ Who by? _EOL_ Word of advice. _EOL_ You're wasting your time. _EOL_ I know what you're doing. Offering Tanya a shoulder to cry on. Reliable. Mr Nice. You tell her how beautiful she looks yet? Or you saving that one up? _EOL_ I know a transitional man when I see him. _EOL_ Don't take me on. You will lose. _EOL_ She'll come back to me. _EOL_ Those are my kids in there. _EOL_ Hey. _EOL_ Soon. _EOL_ I don't think so.

I'm moving out. _EOL_ I'll be gone by tonight. _EOL_ Like you said, I've got options. The flat is all yours again. Enjoy. _EOL_ You gonna make a habit of leaving the kids with other people? _EOL_ Only...Dot yesterday, Ben Mitchelland Lucy Bealetoday. _EOL_ I'm not. Believe me. _EOL_ I'm moving back in. _EOL_ I'm serious. _EOL_ I'm thinking of the children. I want to see them, be with them. All this, it's not their fault. Things are bad enough without them being punished and all. Your fight's with me, Tan. Not them. I thought we agreed to keep them out of it. Don't use them to get at me. It's not fair. _EOL_ I'm just trying to save us some pain. Let's not fight. Not when we're so good together. _EOL_ You know we are. _EOL_ We've got history. I know you. Everything you like...what you need...We fit. You gonna throw that away? _EOL_ Honey, I'm home. _EOL_ Mum's lawyer, Abi. _EOL_ I'm talking to my kids - _EOL_ Pinning a divorce petition on the front door?

Enjoy your biscuits... _EOL_ Not now, Rachel, eh? I'm gonna be late for a funeral. _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ Bradley? Bradley! _EOL_ Your mum says you're headed back to Tring. Sure this is the best move for you right now? What about Dot? She'll miss you with your Grandad away- and besides, it's Tring, Bradley, Tring... you're a young man, you don't want to be cooped up in a place like that... Your sisters, they'll miss you like crazy... little Oscar... and me... I'm so sorry, son. _EOL_ You don't want to listen to me? Can't say I blame you... but going back to your Mum's? That's a step backwards, Bradley, and, deep down, you know it... _EOL_ ‚Leave the girls alone. They're upset.'? What's that supposed to mean? _EOL_ Since when did you win the right to tell me what I can and can't do with my children? _EOL_ And what about bringing Sean Slater round here? Thinking of the girls then, were you? _EOL_ He has if he starts sleeping with their mother. _EOL_ My son's just told me he's leaving, that he don't want anything else to do with me, and I have to come home to this! _EOL_ Lauren, darlin' - _EOL_ It's not as bad as it seems, your mum and me, we're going to calm down now - _EOL_ No. I walked. _EOL_ You and me both.

Blimey, he must really like this one. _EOL_ Me? Nothing... but talk to your brother, ask him about his love-life... _EOL_ Still sore? _EOL_ Not like you to get caught Jack. _EOL_ Thought Jase was supposed to throw out the drunks. That's what you pay him for, innit? _EOL_ For Oscar. Saw it in the market. Babies need stimulating. Gotta start young. Where is he? _EOL_ Dumping him already? _EOL_ So you are dumping him. _EOL_ Snappy ain't you? If you can't cope, I'll help. _EOL_ Oh dear. She's losing it. _EOL_ I'll take this round... _EOL_ And she's telling me to stay away from the kids. _EOL_ That right? _EOL_ No it's fine. I need to know if she's behaving like that. _EOL_ You don't have a clue why I... _EOL_ Just had a very interesting conversation with Keith Miller. _EOL_ How's the head this morning? _EOL_ He reckoned you were tanked. _EOL_ My kids are my business, and if their mother's incapable of looking after ‚em... _EOL_ What is she doing here? _EOL_ Is she staying with you? _EOL_ I don't want you within ten feet of my kids. Do you hear? _EOL_ The junkie's calling me names? _EOL_ Hi, yeah. I need to talk to someone. It's about my kids. I think they're in danger. _EOL_ He got you in the end then. He said he would. I thought you were smarter than that but... What do I know? _EOL_ Regretting it already though - I know that much. It's 4 am. You're either going cos he's slung you out or cos you've just realized how big a mistake it was. _EOL_ They weren't engaged when it started. Yes, I know.I'm everything Tanya's called me. I do know that. _EOL_ You don't think much of me, that's fine. I'm just waiting for the moment you realize Jack's even worse. _EOL_ He's just storing up credit, that's all. Making sure everyone knows he disapproves but then taking me in anyway - cos I'm family. That great East End myth we all peddle - like the hypocrites we are. _EOL_ I'm just trying to solve a problem you've caused, that's all. I ain't having my kids living with a drug addict. _EOL_ There's no such thing. _EOL_ Don't get so drunk the profits start to drop at Booty's, will you? Only when I get the kids, you'll have to start paying me maintenance - you do realize that, don't you? Go on. Slap me. Better that than you take it out on the kids. _EOL_ Tell her to hurry up, can't you? Or get another loo. I can't go in the sink with you here. I'm kidding. What sort of bloke do you think I am? _EOL_ Nah. ‚S woman's work, isn't it? Get Ronnie to do it. _EOL_ Jack. Relax. I do not urinate in your sink. Okay? _EOL_ If you're waiting for Jack, he's seeing Ronnie Mitchell now, sorry. Still, I doubt he'd want my cast-offsanyway. _EOL_ That's a shame. I expect she'll be visiting, mind. _EOL_ ‚S not much of a challenge. _EOL_ They're why I'm doing this. _EOL_ That's a different thing entirely. _EOL_ I made a mistake. I've said that. _EOL_ No. _EOL_ No not at all. Sorry she gave you such a hard time. _EOL_ No, I am. Really, I took advantage of your ignorance, alright, it was out of order, I'm sorry. _EOL_ Yeah you're right. It ain't none of your business. _EOL_ I can't believe you crossed the Square on your own. _EOL_ Yeah, uh... Yeah, looks that way. _EOL_ I know I did, and I tried hard to keep that promise, I did. But I just couldn't alright. And maybe at the end of the day this is the best thing for all of us. _EOL_ I'm sorry babe. I really am. But this is us now. _EOL_ Thing is, right your dad, was a bit stupid. Well. Very stupid. And your mum's had enough of that. So she's got that dvd now, from Christmas, it's evidence, and it means she can hang me. _EOL_ Yeah? _EOL_ Yeah But she has, luv. _EOL_ Babe I'd better just have a quick chat with your mum. _EOL_ I've been calling her. _EOL_ See you later. _EOL_ Me? Watch where you're going. _EOL_ For who? Everything alright? _EOL_ She's still my daughter. And if she's not well I do want to know about her. _EOL_ So who's looking after her? _EOL_ Well make some time will ya. Cos if you're working I'm around today. So, if it's alright with you, I can have her round Jack's. _EOL_ ---Tan--- _EOL_ Maybe you should sort Abi out. Only you stand there playing the concerned mum and you don't even know your own daughter she slipped out of the house last night. _EOL_ She came round to see me, it was gone one o'clock. _EOL_ ---Why d'you think I was calling you? You couldn't even be bothered to pick up the phone could you? No I brought her back meself. _EOL_ I still want to see her. _EOL_ This isn't on. _EOL_ Listen I'll just check my diary--- ---Can you just hold on... _EOL_ Can I call you back in just a sec? Alright thank you. _EOL_ Yeah right And nice to see you an all. _EOL_ What you mean our kids. _EOL_ As far as I know all I did was make her some hot chocolate. _EOL_ I don't know what your problem is but why don't you stick the front door back on its hinges and leave. _EOL_ Well, well... That what I think it is? Oh well that changes things a bit. _EOL_ I did not get Abi to do that. _EOL_ I didn't know about this. alright. What d'you think I am? _EOL_ I didn't get her to do that. _EOL_ I swear to you. On my life. _EOL_ Well it is to me babe. And it is to Abi. She was upset, she came round we had a cuddle... _EOL_ Well Lauren told her stuff. I just backed it up. We sat through there,we didn't say a lot...And we just held each other. _EOL_ Babe - that is one scared and broken little girl. _EOL_ Absolutely. I hold up my hands to that. But that ain't gonna help her. And she's over there now and one of us should be round there with her. Not round here having a barney. _EOL_ Whatever. But I've never seen my little girl in such a state. Because us being together Tan means everything to her. Everything. _EOL_ Well that sounds Great. I can make that. Do you want me to bring anything? _EOL_ Oh come on. _EOL_ Yeh Nice try. _EOL_ I don't think that's fair from a drug taking work obsessed alocholic. _EOL_ Please. Give us a chance... _EOL_ I can't Tan'. Cos I can't. I've Never been able to As far back as I can remember Rachel. Little Bradley on the scene. I knew it weren't fair on any one. We both did. But we never had a choice. did we? Me and you. _EOL_ What? With the DVD ‚misplaced' or whatever word your snotty brief used Tan which way can this go now?; Our money lining the pockets of lawyers. Our lives. Every detail. Out there. On display. I know you _EOL_ ... And I know when you're lying all on your own, you're getting up tending to Oscar, and you're having dinner, you're watching tv, bottle of wine, you're remembering how it used to be... _EOL_ ... Cause so am I... That is what I am holding on to And I couldn't be more sorry. Cause we were good, weren't we?... We were happy. You, me. The girls... You know that ain't a lie. You know you know you want that back. _EOL_ You don't mean that. _EOL_ The Mitchells are gonna love you. _EOL_ Stacey, did you text me last night? _EOL_ Nothing, don't matter. _EOL_ yeah it's just I didn't recognise the number. I thought it might have been you, I thought you might have changed it or something. _EOL_ It said ‚how are you?' _EOL_ Oh well, it's a mystery. _EOL_ Muddling along. You? _EOL_ Sorry to hear that. I'll see ya. _EOL_ If he wants me, he knows where to find me, don't he. _EOL_ What's all that about then? _EOL_ It ain't gonna be just Ronnie that rubs up the wrong way. I mean Phil Mitchell ain't gonna take that lying down is he. _EOL_ yes mate, when I'm ready. _EOL_ Don't matter. _EOL_ Hello, Max Branning. _EOL_ Yeah, who's this? _EOL_ Yeah, so? _EOL_ Right, really? _EOL_ How'd you get my number? _EOL_ No it's fine, I just don't quite understand why, that's all. _EOL_ Yeah.

No harm done. She called me. I was only five minutes away. _EOL_ She's having tea with her mate's. She'll be back at seven. _EOL_ Don't beat yourself up. I mean all's well that ends well. _EOL_ Have you been drinking? _EOL_ Babe, listen, I'll pick you and your sister up tomorrow, yeah? _EOL_ Love ya. _EOL_ Oi! What do you think you're doing? _EOL_ You sure mate, Stacey and Tanya? _EOL_ What's all that about then? _EOL_ Something else I forgot to tell you, an' all - you know his brat of a boy - Jay. _EOL_ Just after I found Tanya plastered on her doorstep. I turn round and he's standing at your car. And I could swear he was just about to do the paint work. _EOL_ yeah. I mean he ran off when I called out but keep an eye on him. _EOL_ How long you been here? And how many enemies you made? _EOL_ Can you believe I'm paying rent for that gaff and I'm kipping on your couch. _EOL_ Why don't you take a look in the mirror, bruv. _EOL_ Ronnie and Selina. _EOL_ I dunno. _EOL_ Do me a favour. _EOL_ Oh blimey... _EOL_ I just thought I'd pop round - check on the girls. I'm a bit concerned on their behalf to be honest. _EOL_ YOu know, all that stuff yesterday. Abi being stranded, all that. _EOL_ We'll go for a pizza, _EOL_ So? _EOL_ Right, well don't worry, I'll make it up to you. _EOL_ Was that strictly necessary? _EOL_ They made any arrests then? _EOL_ You seemed well sure it was Jase Dyer or his son. _EOL_ So how comes they ain't been arrested? _EOL_ What d'you mean waste?! _EOL_ Yeah, well I had a couple of errands to run. So... _EOL_ Sorry make, can't do it. Prior engagement. Family thing. _EOL_ Alright? Any news on the break in? _EOL_ What? So you ain't gonna do anything about it? _EOL_ Well if you don't take control, other people are gonna end up controlling you. _EOL_ Blimey, that ain't the Jack I know. _EOL_ Happy Birthday Tan. You alright Sean? The girls invited me. They did tell you didn't they? _EOL_ Thanks cheers. _EOL_ Well, that was a nice reception. I mean anyone would think you were pleased to see me Tan. _EOL_ What's this? _EOL_ Absinthe? You got any idea how strong that stuff is? You just gonna leave it around for my kids to drink, are you? _EOL_ Sorry Darren. No. _EOL_ Listen, I think you'll find I can do whatever I like. Otherwise this isn't gonna be the only thing you'll leave here without. You get me? _EOL_ Yeah. I'll always be here Tan. 'Cause the kids'll see to that. In fact babe, whatever you do, there's always gonna be my blood's running through their veins. Which means I'll always be in there and up there . Just get used to it yeah? _EOL_ Yeah, come on sweetheart. _EOL_ Go upstairs, get Oscar, you're coming back to mine. _EOL_ She's had too much to drink ain't she darling? She can't look after you properly. Not tonight. Go and help your sister okay? _EOL_ Right, come on girls. Let's go. Quickly. _EOL_ Course she is babe. _EOL_ Er Lauren. I mean you do know it don't matter what people say, don't you? We know your Mum better than anyone. Yeah so what. She enjoys a drink every now and again. Sometimes two, three. _EOL_ It don't mean anything alright. Don't matter what people are saying. _EOL_ No, of course she ain't! All I'm saying is, is just don't take any notice, alright. _EOL_ Don't be like that. I'm sorry I said something now. I just don't want you getting upset again, that's all. _EOL_ Alright, what do you want? _EOL_ Whoa. You're in no fit state. _EOL_ You need to get a grip of yourself, Tan. _EOL_ Well, it's taken you long enough to notice. Why don't you come back when you've got yourself cleaned yourself up? You don't need me for that! It's no wonder they don't want nothing to do with you, I mean just look at the state of you Tanya. _EOL_ What, no big drama's? No effing and blinding? Aren't you gonna get your little claws out? _EOL_ You're catching up. _EOL_ They were your rules Tan, they ain't not mine. Let's not forget that. They're your rules. I wanted to put everything right. Begged you for second chance. But you, you wanted your day in court. You wanted a fight. So this is it. _EOL_ No. You're just too easy to outsmart Tan, that's all. Now if being married to you all these years has taught me one thing, it's that. Do you know I'll always be one step ahead of you. Cheers. _EOL_ Don't fight me. _EOL_ Oh dear, watch yourself Tan. All this bitterness, it might eat you up you know. You'll end up all bitter and alone, you don't want that do you? _EOL_ I don't think so babe. You can't be trusted. _EOL_ Yeah. And I'm their Dad! _EOL_ What did I say? _EOL_ Maybe we should ask the girls what they want. _EOL_ Er yeah, ﬁHello Dadﬂ? ﬁ'Bye, Mumﬂ? _EOL_ Yeah, I'll see ya later. _EOL_ You could come in with me and Abi. He might enjoy the walk? _EOL_ Oi oi Abi, no one's said anything about tomorrow did they? _EOL_ Night girls. _EOL_ Yeah it was... bit of a novelty, ain't it? _EOL_ You know Abi said that you missed some of that. You know, having a laugh... with me. _EOL_ What, so you did say it? _EOL_ Yeah, night. _EOL_ Maybe I'm celebrating. I think... there's still something there. You know, with me and Tanya. _EOL_ She told me she missed me. I tell you mate, if there's a chance, I'll have them all back... _EOL_ Yeah well I've tried mate. He don't wanna know. I think I'll come down the club tonight. _EOL_ It's alright, I know the bloke who runs the club. _EOL_ Yeah well as long as you know I ain't going down without a fight..? _EOL_ Right, where does this go? _EOL_ Well how do I know where to stick it? _EOL_ You don't have to go..if you wanna stick around, have a laugh, whatever. _EOL_ Oh yeah..? _EOL_ Yeah, I suppose. Unless... we both go? _EOL_ Tanya? Nah. She ain't got it in her. _EOL_ Come on, quick Abi. Lauren's beating you in't she. _EOL_ Yeah, it's hard work coming third. _EOL_ Right, I'll get us some drinks. _EOL_ Yeah, I reckon the boys have shown the girls up enough for one night. _EOL_ Oh, so it is. _EOL_ First day I saw her, I knew she was the one... She stared in my eyes and she sighed... _EOL_ On the last day... ... I took her where the wild roses grow... She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief, and I kissed her goodbye... _EOL_ Tan... _EOL_ Tanya... _EOL_ Please, I'm so sorry, ... I'm sorry for hurting ya. Babe I knowthere's something still between us. Pleas just forgive me. _EOL_ Bye... _EOL_ Nah. I think you were right the first time. Me and Tan... it's too late. Hello? _EOL_ Yeah, yeah. Whatever you want. _EOL_ She's letting me go with her, ain't she? She's coming round, Jack. I'm telling you. All I gotta do is be patient. _EOL_ You look nice. _EOL_ You think we're gonna get the third degree? _EOL_ We won't. _EOL_ Tan - _EOL_ We've been doing our best. _EOL_ Keeping an eye on her. _EOL_ Things weren't very good back then. _EOL_ Much better - _EOL_ Scuse me? _EOL_ No, don't. _EOL_ Yeah well she's only gonna get upset in't she. If it's what she really wants. Well i dunno, whatever you think. _EOL_ Thanks anyway. For letting me come. _EOL_ Why don't you just come in for a coffee or something? _EOL_ You say it ain't all for show, why don't we just do it, talk to each other. Communicate. For the kids. _EOL_ Er yeah, well we just keep out of each other's way. Babe, I'm sorry I just can't do this. _EOL_ Small talk, pleasantries. _EOL_ Yeah well I want it back, don't I. You, the girls. What we had. I need it back, Tan. _EOL_ Had this guitar when I was a kid. Saved every penny. Acoustic, nice. I come home one day, Jack and all of his mates had formed a band. We were, I dunno, twelve, thirteen. I saw red. And I smashed it. I loved that guitar, and I smashed it. This is what I do, Tan. _EOL_ Maybe this time I've learned. I mean, how bad do I have to make things for myself? _EOL_ Maybe it's just gonna take me longer than most, to get it through my thick skull, what happiness is. _EOL_ Babe, I dunno... _EOL_ So. That's it then yeah? Can I still see the kids? _EOL_ Yeah well. That's something. _EOL_ It's the least you deserve. You're a fantastic woman Tanya. I love you. Always will. _EOL_ If there's the slightest chance? _EOL_ All the counsellors in the world'll tell you to go. To leave. But only you and me know what's between us. Please let me come back. One last chance. Foot wrong, I'm out. Please. Please let me come back? _EOL_ We're getting back together. _EOL_ Yeah well she loves me, don't she. Always has. _EOL_ Oy. Toy soldier. Had your marching orders yet? _EOL_ That's what you think. You've served your purpose. _EOL_ Yeah well she's using you to get at me, isn't she. _EOL_ Yes I do Sean and it ain't you, alright. So get on your bike. _EOL_ Have you told the girls I might be coming home? _EOL_ Babe, are you genuine about this? _EOL_ Do you know, if Sean Slater's still in the picture... _EOL_ What and that's the honest truth? _EOL_ Alright Babe. I'm sorry. You gonna give him the push? _EOL_ Well why didn't you do it yesterday? _EOL_ No? _EOL_ Babe. You can't lie to me, I know you too well. He was round yours last night. I saw him leave. You know all this trust, honesty, all that. It's got to be both ways innit. _EOL_ What's it look like? _EOL_ Please Babes. Just let me deal with him, will you. _EOL_ What's he doing here, Tan? _EOL_ I've had enough of you. Get out of my house. _EOL_ Yeah. Like she told you. The party's over. I'm moving back in with my wife. _EOL_ Yes. Why don't you listen to me. She don't want you. _EOL_ Why do you think she was ever with you? It was to get at me. She ain't interested in you. She never was. If I ever find you sniffing round my wife ever again... _EOL_ No, course you don't get a choice. She's my wife. Now get out of my house. _EOL_ Well there you go. She can't say it any clearer. _EOL_ So if I ever catch you.. _EOL_ You gonna be alright? I should get back to work. _EOL_ Listen. Are you gonna tell the girls I'm coming home? _EOL_ Tan, it's me. Look. I know I said I'd wait, but not knowing's killing me. I mean, can I move back in or not? Just give us a bell, yeah please? _EOL_ Babe, am I glad to hear you from you. I've been calling you. No of course. I'll come straight round. I'm in the Vic. Tan, don't do that babes, it's heaving in here... _EOL_ And a V & T, please. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'IAN': \"Perhaps I should cook them something. Like I did for Martin when Auntie Pauline, you know... _EOL_ Something like this, on a holiday...New Year'll never be the same, will it? Not for them. _EOL_ Plus they were going to be moving in today. _EOL_ Maybe they'll do it later this week. Less to _EOL_ An apology. _EOL_ What happened to Kevin...made me realise that I shouldn't, you know, take stuff for granted. _EOL_ You. I know you've found this Christmas tough. I didn't have to make it tougher. So... _EOL_ The kids are _EOL_ What...? _EOL_ Jane... _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ Here she is, the face that fried a thousand chips... Can you believe that Ronnie Mitchell? Steals the catering for Kevin's funeral, then comes in to borrow an egg-slicer. I mean, what sort of caterer doesn't have basic equipment? Me and you, we've got to put that buffet through its paces later, probe for weaknesses - _EOL_ Is this about Steven? _EOL_ You see? And people say I don't understand women. _EOL_ How is everyone? _EOL_ How are you all getting to the crematorium? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Hang on, are you saying? _EOL_ But... why? _EOL_ You'll be bunking up with Pete and Bobby, hope that's okay. _EOL_ Yeah, I think so.Far as I can see, the only way this is going to work, is if you treat that house as your home, isn't that right, Jane? _EOL_ Come on, I'll take you over. _EOL_ Steven's worked there before ain't he? He can manage. Half and a white wine thanks. How do you reckon he's doing? _EOL_ Good. I think we should make it permanent. _EOL_ Reckon it's time he joined Team Beale. Help build up the empire. _EOL_ If you print out that photo for me later, I'll get a couple of frames. Thought we could put one up in the chippy as well as the cafe. _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ We can move things around. _EOL_ There isn't one. _EOL_ Ain't a bad idea as it happens. _EOL_ You're too young for make-up. _EOL_ It says here the trials for the Regional schools athletic team will be held next month. Did you know that? We'll have to really boost your training schedule - get you ready in time. _EOL_ It said Walford Harriers on the envelope. I'm his coach, aren't I? It's ridiculous. We've only got a few weeks. They should give us more notification than this. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Peter? Wait. _EOL_ It's Swedish. Means ‚speed play'. It's an exercise programme to help Peter prepare for the school trials. _EOL_ Yes, he does. What he doesn't want, is to work at it. Which is where we come in. We're going to surprise him at school this lunchtime, take him for a first session in the park. _EOL_ And what does a manager do? He delegates. Jane'll cover for you. _EOL_ Peter is going to realize his potential whether he likes it or not. Same goes for the rest of you. Just be grateful he's first. _EOL_ I'm training an Olympic athlete. Vitamin C is essential for muscle strength recovery. I need the highest quality oranges not this dried up old crap on the turn. I've told you before Wes, don't try and line your own pocket by selling rubbish. This is coming out your wages. What are you doing? Where are you going Wes? _EOL_ Yes, previous candidates needn't apply. _EOL_ Doing everyone's head in, is it? _EOL_ So why on earth would I want to end that? _EOL_ Pat - _EOL_ Okay, you're hired. For a trial period - see how we get on. _EOL_ So what are you going to do for him? Or is it just me that's the Samaritan? _EOL_ You leave that stall, the deal's off. Tell her on your time, not mine. And it's minimum wage. _EOL_ You don't like my charity, don't accept it. Do us both a favour. _EOL_ Come on, you maggot - call that a sprint? I could crawl faster. Run! Time? _EOL_ 40? You're meant to beat the previous time, that's the whole point. _EOL_ Not hard enough. I want you puking your guts up cos of the effort you've put into this - not standing there whinging about it. Come on, let's go again. _EOL_ What did I tell you? That is a banned word. We are not at home to Mr Negative. Now go back and try again. I'll untie you when you've beaten forty seconds and not before. He'll thank me for it later. That boy's a winner. He just doesn't know it yet. _EOL_ Look, I'm trying to do this. Here, what are you eating? He can't eat crisps. _EOL_ Because it's not on the list. Only approved nutrition goes in that mouth. And what's she doing here? _EOL_ No. He's going to the gym. Do some Fartleks on the treadmill. Yes, the amusing Swedish word - you won't be laughing at the end of it, I tell you. Go on, get changed. _EOL_ So we'll stop at the sports shop on the way, get you a new pair. Go on, hurry up. And you. Come with me. I want a quick word. _EOL_ Oats, packed with vitamin B, which helps metabolize carbs and fat to produce energy - an essential breakfast for the modern athlete. _EOL_ You're not pregnant, are you? _EOL_ Sorry. _EOL_ Yes, I was really pleased about your grade. Thought I'd surprise you lunchtime. Take you shopping. _EOL_ If he ever gets up in time. He's like the flaming undead. _EOL_ No. It's me you're having problems with - it'll be a chance for us to bond. _EOL_ See, this is what I'm talking about. _EOL_ Whatever I do. It's just never enough, is it? _EOL_ Well, don't get at me. It was your stupid idea in the first place. _EOL_ There's a lot of other places we could've gone. You sure you want to get something here? _EOL_ Well, it's a bit... _EOL_ Yes, they're exactly the words that spring to mind. _EOL_ Is there a finished version? One with sleeves and proper neckline. _EOL_ You mean, napkin. Don't you sell any actual clothes? _EOL_ If you want to get paid, yes he does. _EOL_ An appropriate outfit. Do you work in a lap dancing club? _EOL_ What? Do you mind? I'm talking with my daughter. _EOL_ I said, choose something else. _EOL_ Tough. There is no way I'm paying good money for that. _EOL_ Pounds? Right, that is coming out of your pocket money. _EOL_ And you're grounded. There's no disco tonight. D'you hear me? _EOL_ Monday? That ruins my entire schedule. _EOL_ Recommend someone, did he? His mate I expect, probably gets a back hander for all referrals - see, those coaches, they do it for the money, but me, I'm doing this for Peter. Ain't that right, son? Sorry. _EOL_ No it was just a few gentle stretches. _EOL_ It's ‚Winter training session up at Peter's club. It's our turn to do refreshments. _EOL_ No, he's still gonna go along and watch. _EOL_ No, you're gonna have to come up with some healthier options. While I go take delivery of those new fat fryers! _EOL_ Women on telly, they find the sweaty look sexy, love _EOL_ What's for afters then? Jelly and ice-cream? _EOL_ yeah I know, even more reason to avoid red light food. _EOL_ Yeah, and dairy, fat, oil, sugar. _EOL_ Yeah with green light food. Maybe yellow. This is about as healthy as burger and chips. _EOL_ What are you doing...? _EOL_ Don't be ridiculous. Jane, I've told you before, food goes in the food bin, paper goes in the recycling bin... _EOL_ Why did you chuck this out? _EOL_ I dunno. What do you think I've done? _EOL_ Sort of. _EOL_ He seemed really nice on the phone. _EOL_ Here, I just had a thought, what if they're vegetarian? _EOL_ Well your brother and his fella. Well they're gay ain't they? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ But they might be. _EOL_ What have I said? _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ Yeah but I thought that was the whole point.... _EOL_ Right I've booked Fargo's. _EOL_ Happy now? _EOL_ Yes, we're gonna meet them there. _EOL_ What is all this? _EOL_ Oh, see you later. _EOL_ No, not this time. _EOL_ Lucy will you just leave it, please? _EOL_ Yeah, can you make sure Bobby's in bed by eight yeah? _EOL_ Give him a chance will ya. _EOL_ You know what you're doing, don't you? You're trying to sabotage tonight before it's even begun. _EOL_ You're just determined to have a miserable night. _EOL_ Yeah, and can I point out that that's the millionth time you've said it? _EOL_ Yeah. Hi. _EOL_ Hi Asley, nice to meet you. Um, this is our table if you want to sit down. _EOL_ So Ashley, how DID Christian describe Jane to you? _EOL_ Thank you. That's very kind of you. _EOL_ So you knew David then? _EOL_ And where exactly did you two meet? _EOL_ Why's that? _EOL_ How could I forget? It's the highlight of my year. _EOL_ Er, I'm leaving Steven in charge. _EOL_ Nah, he needs to learn every aspect of the Beale empire. _EOL_ I hope you're not being homophobic. I won't have none of that in my cafe. _EOL_ Do you know what? I was actually looking forward to my first gay wedding. _EOL_ Come on love, we've gotta go. _EOL_ Oh, I'm just glad you two have made peace. _EOL_ Yeah. Well families should be reunited. I'm just chuffed that I'm the one who got you two back together. _EOL_ What with us? What in our house? _EOL_ I'd love Christian to stay. But we just haven't got the room love. _EOL_ He's got no money. So he won't be able to contribute or anything. _EOL_ Remember we've got young boys in the house ain't we? _EOL_ He did make a pass at David. _EOL_ No? _EOL_ Yeah, I suppose so. _EOL_ You what? _EOL_ Is it too much for him to wear some clothes in the morning? _EOL_ Haddock. Over ordered it again. What? _EOL_ I only phoned it through the other day. Have you been messing with my paperwork? _EOL_ Only, I've got a system. Same system I've used for years. _EOL_ I'm gonna have to go down the suppliers. Give them a piece of my mind. So that's where I'm going, now. _EOL_ Yeah? Well, see if you find this funny. I want him out! _EOL_ I'm not changing my mind. I don't want Christian under this roof a minute longer. _EOL_ He's a bad influence. _EOL_ Bet your loving it. Turn up out the blue, stir up load of trouble. _EOL_ Well, I've got you sussed, mate - _EOL_ Jane enjoys her work. Think I know your sister better than you do. _EOL_ Well, I - _EOL_ Alright, Mr Know It All. Come on, tell me. How's this got anything to do with my marriage? Chapter I read was all about cats and Mussolini. Whoa whoa whoa, hold on, you are not going anywhere till you explain to me what you meant. I work hard. I put a roof over everyone's head. And I'm solvent. _EOL_ Come on. I'm asking _EOL_ Eight, nine quid. _EOL_ Alright, I might've let myself go a little bit over the years.... No, hold on. If you're so clever. Stay for a little bit and show me. _EOL_ Please. _EOL_ Hello love. Just doing a little bit of stock taking. _EOL_ Woah. Whoa. What's he done? _EOL_ They're from me. _EOL_ The notes are from me. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. _EOL_ It's Afrikaans. For ‚I love you.' They all are. In different languages. I was trying to be romantic. _EOL_ What do you mean, what do I want? _EOL_ Hungry? _EOL_ I think I can do better than that. Come on. _EOL_ Okay. You can open 'em now. It's all Greek. Everything. All the food....Give us your coat. _EOL_ Wish I could take the credit for it. But it's all down to your brother. _EOL_ Who d'you think's looking after the kids? me and him, we talked things through. I've asked him if he can stay for a bit longer. He doesn't think you're very happy. _EOL_ He showed me this. _EOL_ I know, but - Maybe you're looking for something else? _EOL_ More bedpans and strip lighting. Still thought you were amazing though. _EOL_ Jane, I love you. I love waking up next to you in the morning. Coming home to you at night. I love Friday nights, you, me and the kids, sat on the sofa eating our tea, watching the telly. _EOL_ Antiques Roadshow. I know alot of people are gonna find that boring. To me. It's the most wonderful thing in the world. _EOL_ I got the vol-au-vents. _EOL_ How you getting on with the filling? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Look, I know this orders only for twenty people, but my mate at the Council reckons he could turn this into a regular. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ No no, there isn't a problem - I just need to check a few details. Yeah yeah, I did get your fax - - Um, it's just my young lad - he spilt some orange juice over it that was all. Right. So it was vol-au-vents, a selection of sandwiches, some crisps, sasuage rolls...and how many was it in the party? _EOL_ Two hundred - _EOL_ No no, it's fine, it's all in hand. Um...yeah yeah, we'll see you then. Bye. _EOL_ Oh, what else was I gonna say? _EOL_ We'll just have to make more. _EOL_ Yeah I can count. _EOL_ I don't believe this - _EOL_ Oh yeah, course I can, why do you think I'm leaning down here? _EOL_ Well it's a bit difficult not to when she's asking stupid questions. _EOL_ That was down to Billy. _EOL_ Does it matter how my hand got stuck down here, how do we get it out? _EOL_ Did I ask you? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Shut up Bill. _EOL_ Oh I'm glad somebody round here's doing some thinking. _EOL_ You two selling tickets? What are we going to do about the food? _EOL_ I mean there's all those extra vol-au-vents to collect - and the filling. _EOL_ How do you think I got my hand stuck down here in the _EOL_ Oh razor sharp, as always Mickey. _EOL_ Will you shut up! _EOL_ Yeah well don't - _EOL_ I'm freezing. Did you get the vol-au-vents? _EOL_ Oh ha ha, what about the fillings? _EOL_ Oh, did you get a selection? _EOL_ I was getting my keys. _EOL_ Right. Where are we? _EOL_ Have you done it? _EOL_ Is everything OK? _EOL_ Yeah. Yeah. Not bad. _EOL_ Um. No. _EOL_ Yeah, there's a good reason for it. _EOL_ Not here alright. There's too many flapping ears. _EOL_ Yeah, look I'll tell you when we get home alright. I've got a little announcement to make. _EOL_ After you went to bed. _EOL_ Civil partnership. Gay weddings. Look I never knew how big they were until Christian showed me. It's a whole new market, just waiting to be tapped. _EOL_ The pink pound. _EOL_ It's a good business opportunity. _EOL_ Sometimes, in business, right, you have to get into bed with some unusual people - - well metaphorically speaking - - doesn't mean you have to stay there alright? Once that person's outlived their usefulness you move on. _EOL_ Can I help you? _EOL_ No, it, it can't be. Clare, Debbie's little girl? _EOL_ No. What you doing here? _EOL_ He's done this to you? _EOL_ Come on, come on in. _EOL_ Sorry, I... _EOL_ No. Well strictly speaking it's cheaper after six. I wasn't sure what you'd like... _EOL_ Yeah fine. _EOL_ No it's Jane's she's not one to make a splash. _EOL_ Oh oh oh. I'll leave you to it. _EOL_ Don't mention it. _EOL_ Think this is funny... _EOL_ You startled me. _EOL_ This is Clare... Clare Tyler. _EOL_ Yeah, um, Clare's step dad was an old friend of mine. _EOL_ Shall we um, leave Clare to get changed? I'll er, I'll pit the kettle on yeah? _EOL_ Incase I forget later... You might wanna look me up or something. _EOL_ You er, you sure you have to go? Dot'd love to see you. _EOL_ Are you sure you don't need any mon.. _EOL_ Yeah in here. _EOL_ See ya. _EOL_ Hello, Ian Beale. _EOL_ No, it's not a problem.... We can sort that out for you Mrs Watson....yeah, it'll be an absolute pleasure. Thanks for calling. Bye. _EOL_ Oh right. 'Fit for a Queen'?! I didn't agree to that! _EOL_ Well, it's a bit... _EOL_ And we might be needing them sooner than you think. You might have named the business but I've just got us our first contract. _EOL_ Children's party. Community Centre. _EOL_ That'll be the down and outs. They let them in at weekends when it's cold outside. _EOL_ Oh don't worry, it'll be fine once you've decorated it. _EOL_ There's twenty quid. Go and get some balloons, and some party poppers and stuff... _EOL_ I thought you'd enjoy the creative challenge...after all you are...artistic.. _EOL_ Gotta take this one. Councillor Dickinson! What can I do for you? Civic lunch? Well yeah as it happens.... I've just had a cancellation. So..yes I'm free. Fantastic. I'll see you there at 12.30. _EOL_ Myfirst rule of business. Never pass up an opportunity to network. _EOL_ It'll get done. Trust me. _EOL_ hello love. _EOL_ Your brother has got a certain flair. But he's got a lot to learn about business, which is why I'm perfectly positioned to be his mentor. Hiya. _EOL_ There's no need to. It looked great on you. _EOL_ Everything okay round at Dot's? _EOL_ So... You gonna stick around for a bit? _EOL_ Really? _EOL_ Yes. Obviously we can use somebody with your... assets. _EOL_ Are we? _EOL_ Dot! _EOL_ Come on Dot, I'm in a hurry! _EOL_ Yeah I need them for a party this afternoon. If Dot can spare the time. _EOL_ Much appreciated. I wish my staff had your attitude to customer service. _EOL_ Everything alright? _EOL_ yeah I had to pop home and get changed. I've got a lunch at the town hall. Didn't I mention it? _EOL_ Oh no, I wouldn't do that. Here's the menu. Should be perfectly within your capabilities. _EOL_ You're always saying how fantastic women are at multi tasking. It'll be a breeze.Seeya. _EOL_ Oi! I heard that! _EOL_ It was just a few sausages on sticks.... _EOL_ I was networking. Getting us contacts. And I am not drunk. I met a lovely fella, Councillor Tunstall, he was very interested.. _EOL_ Well... Nothing firm. But at this stage it's all about building relationships.... _EOL_ You gonna let him talk to me like that? _EOL_ Where you going? _EOL_ There's a half naked man in our house. I think he's got something to do with your brother! _EOL_ Oh no! How can I? My house has been invaded by the Village People. _EOL_ What, you think it's funny do you? It's alright for Christian to bring back whoever he likes. Whenever he likes. It's our house! _EOL_ I'm glad to hear it! I shouldn't be confronted by some hairy bloke's lunchbox every time I wanna stick the kettle on. What about the kids! _EOL_ Go on then, I want it sorted. Now! _EOL_ I think you owe me an apology. _EOL_ Steven! Family meeting. Now. _EOL_ Jane see you come over? _EOL_ Good. Because the time has come for me to take matters into my own hands. _EOL_ Christian. _EOL_ Well..we're all aware that ...he's... different.... _EOL_ From me for instance....Well he's of a different... _EOL_ Now I never said that. _EOL_ It doesn't matter what he is. It's who he's bringing back here. And what they're doing? _EOL_ My point exactly. Peter? _EOL_ You spoke to him? _EOL_ Well. I think we should have a vote on this. All those in favour of Christian turning our home into a love hotel raise your hand. You look a bit ﬁundecidedﬂ there Peter. _EOL_ All those against. _EOL_ That new game you wanted comes out Friday, doesn't it? Motion carried. _EOL_ You're not homophobic, are you Phil? Cos you know what they say don't ya? That just means you're a little bit Dorothy yourself. _EOL_ Maybe that's why he's so angry, he's repressed. _EOL_ I'm messing, I'm messing. _EOL_ No, I'm not. He kept bringing blokes back to the house. I don't want a naked stranger in my kitchen. _EOL_ Yah. _EOL_ Might as well have been. Peter's at an impressionable age. _EOL_ She don't understand. _EOL_ Yeah. He's not staying at our house either alright. He'll _EOL_ Yeah yeah I can, I'll er, yeah I'll see you then. Thank you. It's five grand. _EOL_ Five grand. Or maybe more. Just for a birthday party. _EOL_ No, it's the councillor I met at the lunch on Monday. The one I was telling you about - Edward Tunstall. He's really impressed by me and said he'd come round and we'd discuss some ideas. _EOL_ Well, this just proves I don't need him. He was holding me back. _EOL_ I've got to go home, sort out some, you know, menus, taster dishes - _EOL_ That's alright love, you'll cope. _EOL_ It's five grand. _EOL_ Come on, come on through. _EOL_ Nah, it's alright, it's not a problem. I've er, just been working on some appetizers to tingle you taste buds. Can I take your coat? _EOL_ And er, how about a drink, a cup of tea or er, maybe a glass of wine? _EOL_ Well, the party starts as soon as you set foot in my door. It's satisfaction guaranteed. _EOL_ Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that. _EOL_ The best kind. Loud and proud yeah? _EOL_ Yeah, we can do that. Absolutely. _EOL_ Yes, um, me and my partner, er Christian. Who, actually he, he should be here by now. I tell you, why don't you have a little taste and um, I'll see if I can find him, I won't be a sec. _EOL_ Christian please, I'm begging you. This guy is seriously loaded. _EOL_ And think of all his gay friends - right this is the pink pound market - disposable income, no kids, it's business heaven. _EOL_ Yeah well, stay with us, stay at our house, on the sofa, just like you were before. I want you to, I mean you're my Brother-In-Law, you're part of the family now. _EOL_ Here we are, back again, Edward, this is my partner Christian, Christian this is Edward. Oh, excuse me, that's me vibrating, I have to take this. _EOL_ Yes Jane, I'm busy. What sort of crisis? Okay, I'll be straight round. Sorry, I'm going to have to go deal with this. _EOL_ No, um, I'll be straight back, I promise. Edward, how's the appetizers? _EOL_ We aim to please. See you in a minute. _EOL_ For the last time. It is not a gay date. _EOL_ No, it's a business meeting. Okay, I am going out for dinner with a client, who just happens to be gay, for a business meeting. _EOL_ Remember you're here under sufferance. Once we've got this party planned we're having another vote. _EOL_ Yes, there is some confusion, but as soon as I meet him I'm gonna put him straight on a few things. _EOL_ That's an appalling thing to say. Look are you suggesting that I would lead someone on just to get what I want? _EOL_ So much for moral guidance. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Hold on. I haven't got a mincey vibe. No, I am one hundred per cent red blooded heterosexual. Ask Jane. _EOL_ What d you mean suppose? It's not guesswork love. I mean am I or am I not a heterosexual? We have sex? _EOL_ No hold on. My masculinity's been impugned here. Look I want you to tell them that we have a marriage in the fullest sense of the word. Well? _EOL_ Oh that is it. We are having another vote. Steven? _EOL_ Nope. _EOL_ Well, I'll wear a suit. _EOL_ I dunno. Same one I wore at lunch time, probably. _EOL_ How long's he going to keep this up? _EOL_ Funny. _EOL_ Right. So, what invite? _EOL_ That's amazing, I mean, wow. That is seriously impressive. _EOL_ You're joking? _EOL_ Good for you. _EOL_ Seven thousand? _EOL_ Yeah why not? _EOL_ Just because he's homosexual doesn't mean his party has to have a ‚pink' theme. _EOL_ Doesn't leave room for much else, does it?! _EOL_ Lucy, will you just shut up. _EOL_ Look, you're all treating this like some sort of giggle - like it doesn't really matter. I'm sorry, it does! This is our first big contract and we have to be professional about it. _EOL_ My shoulder's killing me and I need to get to the caff. _EOL_ Excuse me. Rent? _EOL_ You said that last week. _EOL_ I slept on it funny, something's gone. _EOL_ A massage! I don't need a massage, If you wanna help, do something about your brother, he's driving me mental. _EOL_ yeah well it does. _EOL_ Well it's Edward... ...He's invited me to this recpetion... _EOL_ Yeah. At Buckingham Palace, I'm gona meet the Queen. _EOL_ Yeah, me and Edward... _EOL_ That's the whole point. _EOL_ Look love, I can handle him alright. And this is really important to me. Don't go mad. _EOL_ I'm really sorry, they must have all got throw out when we moved in. _EOL_ Oh - yeah, it's much better thanks. _EOL_ Really? _EOL_ Excuse me. What? _EOL_ What about it? _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'JANE': \"Maybe. _EOL_ I know. _EOL_ Like that's what they're thinking about. _EOL_ What's going on? _EOL_ What's the matter with you both? _EOL_ If you two can't decide, I will.LUCY/ _EOL_ Bobby likes it. _EOL_ They're all yours. I'm going over to the cafe. _EOL_ No way. _EOL_ Bad in there, is it? _EOL_ That feeling doesn't go away for a while. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Denise is strong. She'll get through this. The others, too. _EOL_ And what about you? _EOL_ You worry about Denise. The girls. How're you doing? _EOL_ Ian? What's this? _EOL_ For what? _EOL_ Stuff? _EOL_ This isn't right. _EOL_ Like I said, something was missing. I've spent a lot of time these last couple of weeks being scared...and angry... But, you know what? It doesn't matter. None of it. Not really. All that matters is sitting here, round this table. _EOL_ Like there wasn't enough, already. _EOL_ Something Pat said. Not important. Let's eat. _EOL_ I don't care, Ian... I don't care if her puff pastry has got the consistency of a brick... I. Don't. Care. _EOL_ Steven? Why should it be about Steven?... Yes, it's about Steven. _EOL_ It's like you're inside my head... _EOL_ No... _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ No, you must go. _EOL_ D'you want to ride with us? _EOL_ He'll have to share a room with Peter and Bobby. _EOL_ Steven. If he moves in. Ain't fair to make Lucy share, not at her age. _EOL_ I'm saying, I'll give it a try... _EOL_ ‚Cause in the end, no matter what he's done, he's family... _EOL_ ‚Course. _EOL_ Ian! I'm going to pick Bobby up from school, d'you want anything from the supermarket? _EOL_ You didn't. It's fine. _EOL_ Yeah, well... not me you've got to thank, it's Ian. _EOL_ What's she doing here? _EOL_ Yeah, you have, only I'm trying not to use it in front of Bobby. _EOL_ Bobby, go through there, darlin'. _EOL_ You want to stay here, Steven? Rule number one: the only tarts in my kitchen have got jam on top. _EOL_ Get her out of my kitchen, she ain't hygienic. _EOL_ Don't mind. Cook if you like. _EOL_ Then why did you ask? Not having a go at you, just saying. _EOL_ I shouldn't leave him on his own... _EOL_ Fine. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Sorry Chelsea. _EOL_ Hang on Steven. _EOL_ What do you think you're doing? I'd already said no! _EOL_ You've only been here five minutes. Anyway it's not down to you. _EOL_ You know I've been thinking. You might be better off working in the Chippy. _EOL_ But we're fully staffed. What with us two and Marie. _EOL_ Alright, but it'd save us a wage. Wouldn't have to employ so many outsiders. Plus it's a better job. You could be Assistant Manager. _EOL_ Exactly. It's about time we had someone in there in a position of authority. _EOL_ Lucy - _EOL_ Ian. _EOL_ I'm sure it would. But since Bobby was the one who ruined it, ask him for the money. Okay? _EOL_ Ian, look, she got an A+. _EOL_ Ian? _EOL_ Why not? _EOL_ He bulk ordered. It was cheaper that way. _EOL_ Ian. _EOL_ Ian, tell her. Lucy, wait. We are going to get you something. A new outfit. For the school disco. _EOL_ I'm taking it. Cos Steven needs to be at his job. _EOL_ Make more sense, wouldn't it? _EOL_ Lucy, wait - _EOL_ It's just a slight sprain, I took him to the doctors - there's nothing to worry about - _EOL_ Yes, well the doctor had a few words to say about that as well. He advised that we consult someone qualified, get more expert advice. _EOL_ Where's your key? _EOL_ Nowhere to put it, eh. Look I hope you didn't push Peter too hard, love? _EOL_ That gear doesn't _EOL_ I thought he was sitting this week out? _EOL_ Well I don't suppose anything from the cafe or the chippy will be right? _EOL_ Shower. Now. _EOL_ They've all had nose jobs. No sense of smell. Go, urgh! _EOL_ I'm still looking for inspiration. _EOL_ Outdone myself, I think. I've got mini pizzas and quiche, some vegetarian, some not. I've got greaded fish and chicken goujons. Chopped vegetables and dips. And cheese and fruit platter. _EOL_ Well, you're all still kids really in't ya! _EOL_ Fruit flan. You said healthy. _EOL_ Red light? There's a stack of fruit and veg in this lot. _EOL_ They've gotta replace their energy somehow, Ian. _EOL_ Typical. I can't do enough for this family and what I do is never right.... _EOL_ Might as well... _EOL_ If you think you can do better, go ahead. _EOL_ YOU want to go? _EOL_ Alright, I've had enough of this. _EOL_ The looks. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Peter? First the massage, then the chicken chasseur. I'm not an idiot, Ian. Have you done what I think you've done? _EOL_ I think you've invited Christian over, haven't you? _EOL_ Sort of? What was the last thing I said to you this morning? _EOL_ I wasn't talking to you. Well? _EOL_ Christian? Nice? You have absolutely no idea what you have done! _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ Oh Ian... _EOL_ Sometimes I... _EOL_ It doesn't matter. _EOL_ Yes they might be. You might be quite right. _EOL_ Look, since this is down to you, I don't want them coming to the house. It's going to have to be a restaurant. _EOL_ I don't want the kids being involved. _EOL_ Why does everything have to turn into an argument Ian? Just for once will you do what I say? _EOL_ No fuss? _EOL_ Let me get this straight: it's your twenty fifth wedding anniversary. Your wife says ‚no fuss' and you believe her? When a woman says ‚no fuss' she doesn't mean ‚no fuss'; she actually means ‚I want an awful lot of fuss, please'. _EOL_ Well I don't know. A meal at the very least. Have you got her a present? _EOL_ Your life's not going to be worth living mate. _EOL_ Thank you. _EOL_ And we're gonna meet them there yeah? _EOL_ And you're not to bring them back to the house afterwards, alright? _EOL_ Just trust me on this one, Ian. _EOL_ And a good one at that. _EOL_ Mmm. You're on your own there mate. _EOL_ Mmm? _EOL_ Not particularly no. _EOL_ In hope I imagine. Right, er, let's go if we're going. _EOL_ This is just typical. Him not turning up. _EOL_ I'm fed up giving Christian chances. _EOL_ I beg your pardon? _EOL_ Can I just point out that tonight was NOT my idea? _EOL_ Oh. Pleased to meet you. _EOL_ It's ‚Jane' nowadays, thank you Christian. _EOL_ Bit hard to get a word in edgeways Christian. _EOL_ Three years ago. _EOL_ Time to time - yes of course I do. _EOL_ No, he's exactly the same as he always was. _EOL_ Remember we're seeing the accountant later. _EOL_ Who's covering? _EOL_ You're joking? _EOL_ Oh does he now? _EOL_ I know, it's incredible ain't it? _EOL_ Well, you'll have to wait a while, 'cause, well I don't know when we'll see Christian again. _EOL_ I'm not surprised the way you talked to him. _EOL_ You mean you liked his money? _EOL_ What do you mean? Me and Ian love each other very much. _EOL_ We own it. _EOL_ What d'you want Christian? _EOL_ Oh, well, I'm sure you'll find somewhere. You always land on your feet. You don't want to stay with fat, boring old Lesley? And her boring husband and her boring kids. _EOL_ Um, look we've got an appointment. I'll talk to Ian. Any problems give us a call. _EOL_ I can't believe he's back. _EOL_ Yeah? _EOL_ So you won't mind if he stays for a week or two? _EOL_ It's a big house. Look, there's plenty of room. _EOL_ He can stay rent free for a couple of weeks alright? _EOL_ Hah. I hope you're not being homophobic Ian? _EOL_ yeah of course, he likes older men, so if anyone should be worried... _EOL_ Ian, this may come as a bit of a surprise to you, but you're not everyone's cup of tea. You're certainly not Christian's. _EOL_ Of course not. So he can stay? Yeah? _EOL_ Great. _EOL_ Stop it. Hi. Ian's said you can stay. _EOL_ Yeah I hope not. _EOL_ Christian. He's winding you up Ian. _EOL_ Hmmm? _EOL_ The amount of flesh on show. Not everyone's used to half naked homosexuals in the morning, Christian. _EOL_ Ian's got certain standards. _EOL_ If you're staying in his house. Better for everyone, if you go along with them. _EOL_ You have to be organised in business. _EOL_ Christian! Loads of things. This Greek Island, the war...Mainly about this girl, she promises to marry a local fisherman. Then the army invade an' she falls desperately in love with an Italian captain. That's when she realises. She was never in love with the fisherman at all. _EOL_ Nothing. _EOL_ Ian, I never ever mess with your paperwork. _EOL_ Do you have to? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Ian's taking the kids ice skating after school. _EOL_ We can have a quiet night in. Bottle of wine, DVD. _EOL_ Suppose your idea of a good night out involves wearing a T-shirt several sizes too small. An' sniffing that stuff that makes your brain explode. _EOL_ Yeah well, you get older. You're idea of fun changes. _EOL_ Ian's got loads of good qualities. He's kind, loyal...safe. _EOL_ He's got strong family values. An' he works hard - _EOL_ You're really funny, Christian. Hilarious. _EOL_ Me and the kids had a scrabble tournament last week. _EOL_ This isn't really my scene. _EOL_ I could get used to this. _EOL_ It's not really Ian's thing. Oh come on, give the poor bloke a break. _EOL_ Of course I do. However hard that might be for you to believe, Christian. I love Ian very much. _EOL_ It's not romantic fiction. It's literature. _EOL_ Shut up! _EOL_ You haven't?! No! _EOL_ What happened? I'll tell you what happened. I became a widow at thirty-three, that's what happened! I woke up one day, with no husband. No idea what I was gonna do with my life - _EOL_ He was there. When I was in a long tunnel, with no light at the end. When I needed someone to pick up the pieces. Ian was there. _EOL_ Yeah. If you like. _EOL_ Grant was... irrelevant. _EOL_ See, that's the trouble with you gay guys. You're just like straight men. Only worse. Cos you haven't figured out yet, have ya? It'd not all about sex. And that's all Grant was. Sex. _EOL_ Bloody brilliant! But that's not the point. Grant was like... too many shots of tequila. A rush of euphoria, followed by a million and one regrets. But Ian - he'd lay down his life for me. How many people d'you get to say that about? _EOL_ Ian, what're you doing? We were just having a laugh. _EOL_ We were having fun, Ian. You know, laughing, drinking too much. _EOL_ Fine. Have it your way. But if you think I'm standing behind that counter, scraping bacon fat, without a word of complaint for the rest of my life. You've got another thing coming mate! _EOL_ Where's Steven? I'm gonna kill him! _EOL_ These. All over the caff. In weird languages. I knew it was only a matter of time. _EOL_ Then, when I've wrung his neck, I'm going straight down the police... What? _EOL_ ‚Et is lief vir jou.'? _EOL_ If you'd said Je t'aime, I might've stood a chance. _EOL_ Last time I got a bunch of flowers, you wanted the freezers clearing out. _EOL_ There's lasagnes in the freezer. _EOL_ Oh Ian - _EOL_ I thought he'd gone? _EOL_ I don't see him for years. He turns up, with this whole protective brother thing going on. _EOL_ It's a book, Ian. You get them in shops, libraries - _EOL_ There's so much about the world I don't know. _EOL_ It wasn't exactly violins and sunsets when we first met, was it? _EOL_ More amazing than Cindy? _EOL_ Breakfast in bed on _EOL_ Fair bit of smiling going on last night as well, thanks to you. _EOL_ That wasn't all.CHRISTIAN SMILES PLEASED. _EOL_ Nothing lasts. _EOL_ Good-bye Captain Corelli. _EOL_ I'm going as fast as I can. _EOL_ OK, OK. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ All in hand? _EOL_ Never mind what to say, what we gonna do? _EOL_ Shut up you. _EOL_ Do you mean that? _EOL_ You, trying to be helpful? _EOL_ Offer gratefully accepted. _EOL_ Can't you just take it out? _EOL_ Oh Billy put your hand down the grate? _EOL_ Mickey's right, if you got it down there you must be able to get it back. _EOL_ Christian's right, Ian. _EOL_ Well I'll have to do it. _EOL_ Well Christian can get those, give us the car keys. _EOL_ Ian, you've had your hand down a drain for the past couple of hours, we do not want to the Public Health on our backs. _EOL_ Done well hasn't he? _EOL_ Not bad. The boy's a natural. _EOL_ You've got a real flair for this. _EOL_ Yeah. It's good to see the two of them getting on so well at last. _EOL_ Yeah, you're right, it is a bit weird. _EOL_ He does seem a bit more tolerant all of a sudden. _EOL_ Very funny. _EOL_ Anything interesting? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Er, no, I don't think so, no. _EOL_ Um, this is nice to see. You and my brother getting on so well. Hardly seen you all morning, you two spending so much time together. _EOL_ Which is? Ian? _EOL_ Private is it? _EOL_ What is all this? I could hardly get you and Ian to exchange a civil word earlier in the week and now we can't get you apart. And what's this big announcement he wants to make? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ All the time what? _EOL_ I'm just surprised you're doing it with Ian. _EOL_ Well, here's to a long and happy union. _EOL_ Are you, um, planning on ordering anything? _EOL_ Is that right? _EOL_ He's my husband if you must know. _EOL_ And you are? _EOL_ I'd steer well clear... ... Unless you like the type of girl that makes you pay for extras. _EOL_ That'll be two quid. _EOL_ There's one born every minute. _EOL_ I hate to break it to you, sweetheart. But the fellas round here. They ain't gonna fall for it. _EOL_ Ian... _EOL_ What the hell are you doing? _EOL_ Oh, I'm sorry. I'll knock next time. _EOL_ I bet he did. Is that my dress? _EOL_ That's ‚cos I was saving it. _EOL_ Well, what about my dress? _EOL_ Why don't you get Clare a taxi Ian? _EOL_ Are you sure you haven't got time to see Dot? _EOL_ Clare was just leaving, Dot. _EOL_ Be our guest. _EOL_ It's a proper little miracle. _EOL_ And to think you almost missed her. _EOL_ Bye Dot. _EOL_ How'd it go? Christian come round to the party idea? _EOL_ Trouble is we're a bit over-staffed here. _EOL_ But we do have another business you'd be perfectly suited for. Come with me. You can stop drooling now Ian. _EOL_ You'll be working under Steven our assistant manager - either here or on the chip van. It can be tough on your skin... So you'll have to expect a few more spots than normal. And it can be hard to get the smell of chip fat out of your clothes.... So always wear your white coat and hat... We don't want that lovely hair of yours running with grease now, do we.... Here. Try this for size. _EOL_ Not sure I'd trust you with the till anyway. Ian's wallet was a lot lighter after your little visit. _EOL_ I think we understand each other. _EOL_ No. It's been manic. I thought you were only going to the launderette? _EOL_ No you flaming well didn't. What about the party? You can't just dump it all on Christian. _EOL_ Me?!! How am I supposed to do all this? And run the cafe! _EOL_ Sorry. We've been really busy. I haven't made half of it yet. _EOL_ If it was that simple you should've got it all sorted before getting drunk with your lardy di da mates down the Town Hall. _EOL_ What goes around comes around Ian. _EOL_ Paracetamol's in the kitchen cupboard! _EOL_ Ian! Concentrate! _EOL_ Don't be ridiculous. _EOL_ Of course not. _EOL_ Look, there's no need to shout. I agree with you alright? I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. _EOL_ Didn't know you could do all this? _EOL_ yeah well, It's your other partners he's worried about. What the hell were you playing at bringing that bloke back to our house? _EOL_ You set that up. I knew it. _EOL_ This is serious Christian. I'm just as angry as he is. And before you say anything I'd feel exactly the same if it was a woman. _EOL_ Show some respect. This is our family home. Do it again and you're out. _EOL_ Alright, okay, enough. Alright? Just pack it in. Christian went because Ian didn't want him there. Because he's scared of him too. _EOL_ He wasn't naked. _EOL_ Being gay isn't contagious. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ That's got to be a wind-up. _EOL_ Except you don't have Christian anymore. _EOL_ What are you doing? _EOL_ Oh no. You are not leaving me here on my own over lunch time. Not with Marie off as well. It's like rush hour. _EOL_ Now you listen to me. Do you ever want us to have sex again? Because that's the choice you're making here. _EOL_ Would that be before or after he signs the contract? _EOL_ Lucy. _EOL_ Erm...well, yeah, I suppose. _EOL_ Well yes. I am delighted to be able to announce, here at breakfast, that your father is a heterosexual man. _EOL_ Til he knows he's not getting to you. _EOL_ Well, behave yourself. Just becuase he's paying for dinner doesn't mean you owe him anything. _EOL_ Is that a new aftershave? _EOL_ Mmm. _EOL_ What about Pink Floyd as background music? _EOL_ What's the big deal? _EOL_ What was all this about your shoulder? _EOL_ Right. I'm gonna book you a massage. _EOL_ Yeah, yeah... Look Ian, what's the big deal? You're treating this contract like your life depended on it. _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ A reception. _EOL_ The Queen? _EOL_ On what basis is Edward taking you to Buckingham Palace? _EOL_ Oh Ian! _EOL_ What's the point, if you're gonna get so wound up about it? _EOL_ Hello? I'd like to book a massage for my husband please. _EOL_ And you're sure you've got all the nibbles sorted? Well I could rustle up a few cakes if you like? Leave that with me and I'll see what I can do. No no no, you can have it at cost. Because you're a mate and it's because it's just brilliant you've decided to live a little. I'll call back to to confirm. Cheers, bye. _EOL_ Don't start, Ian. Tanya's having a birthday party tomorrow night and we're helping out. It's called _EOL_ We're not doing anything, are we? _EOL_ Why you doing here anyway? I thought you were planning menus with Christian. _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ So? _EOL_ So? _EOL_ You can't kick him out again. he's got nowhere else to go. _EOL_ No, Ian - that's the point - Christian is very far from a grown up. _EOL_ Absolutely no way am I telling him. _EOL_ Ian, this was your idea. You started it - so you see it through. _EOL_ I just feel bad about turfing him out. He's me brother. _EOL_ His lot? _EOL_ I need to get round Tanya's, start setting up this party. _EOL_ You know it is. Why? _EOL_ Search me. _EOL_ You've still got it! _EOL_ No. You are what's known as a yummy mummy! And you're only thirty-three. _EOL_ Relax. Honey's keeping an eye on him. Look, have a glass of bubbly. _EOL_ Fruit juice? _EOL_ Has it? _EOL_ Look I'll sort it out, go on. _EOL_ Oh, it's early yet. _EOL_ He's too young for you! And he's got a girlfriend. _EOL_ Doing the books. _EOL_ Well um, you won't have to go far for chips. _EOL_ Course. Um, it's the least we could do. _EOL_ I still can't believe he had the nerve to show up. _EOL_ Really? _EOL_ Exactly.TANYA/ _EOL_ Cheers. _EOL_ Bit of Sambuca. _EOL_ What is babe? _EOL_ She was fine earlier. _EOL_ Tan Tan. I think it's about time you called it a night yeah? _EOL_ So how are you? _EOL_ No. Alright, it wasn't your finest hour. _EOL_ Well, I was a bit surprised myself. _EOL_ No course not, but...but Sean Slater? _EOL_ Well he's a bit of a loose cannon, isn't he? I mean is he, is he the type of man you want in your life? Around your kids? _EOL_ You can't blame Max for being concerned, he is their father. _EOL_ Oh yeah, but... _EOL_ Well, you were a bit... full on. _EOL_ I am! But I'm worried about you. You'd only had a couple of drinks and you were absolutely paralytic! _EOL_ It wasn't like you at all. And suddenly Sean Slater's on the scene, I don't know what to think... _EOL_ We haven't won the lottery or something have we? _EOL_ Stop it! _EOL_ It's an eyebrow hair Ian. Not The Thing. _EOL_ Ian's worried about signs of aging. _EOL_ We'll do it once the _EOL_ Oh he already jogs. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'STACEY': \"That would be down to the gallon and a half of water you drank. _EOL_ Don't worry about me. I drank plenty. _EOL_ Just letting my hair down. New Year's Eve, remember? _EOL_ So what did you do last _EOL_ Lister was looking for you. I don't think-- _EOL_ Come on. _EOL_ It's not that important, is it? _EOL_ Don't, Bradley... _EOL_ Sorry? _EOL_ No... _EOL_ What d'you mean? _EOL_ So I said, I've always had a discount, so don't call me a liar when I ain't. I was right, don't you reckon? Sean? _EOL_ Steven! _EOL_ Will you mind my stall for half an hour? _EOL_ Look, just tell me yes or no. _EOL_ Bradley? Saw your mum... she said you were leaving. So. Is it true? _EOL_ I don't... _EOL_ I don't know... _EOL_ Don't go. _EOL_ Don't go. If you're going ‚cause of me, I can leave, stay with Little Mo and Freddy for a while. _EOL_ It'd give you a week or two, chance to think things through. _EOL_ If you're just going to - _EOL_ Well, if you're not angry, maybe there's a chance... you know? A chance to talk properly. _EOL_ But - _EOL_ Where are you going? _EOL_ Kicked you out? _EOL_ ‚Course you did. See, it's all coming back on you, Max. _EOL_ Just say what you want to say and clear off. _EOL_ So? _EOL_ I ain't seen him today. _EOL_ What are you trying to do, Max? _EOL_ Why've you been keeping your phone turned off? _EOL_ So you ain't got a new girlfriend or nothing. _EOL_ ‚Cause you'd tell me - _EOL_ This is nothing... it's just Bradley leaving, sent me a bit loopy... feel like everything's falling apart... _EOL_ He's always fancied her. _EOL_ Didn't think so... but there's definitely something going on. He's acting really weird. _EOL_ Max said he was seeing some woman. _EOL_ You don't know Max. He likes his little games. _EOL_ What if she's trying to _EOL_ I've got a name. _EOL_ ‚Scuse me? _EOL_ You cow! _EOL_ See that's what I have to put up with, and the only people I could guarantee wouldn't judge me were my Mum and Sean. _EOL_ I don't want to get you in trouble... _EOL_ I need to talk to my brother! _EOL_ You lied to me? _EOL_ Think you've got him good, don't you? _EOL_ Feelings for you? Don't fool yourself. _EOL_ You smug cow. Look at you, standing there, thinking you've got one over... tell you this, if Sean really cared about you, don't you think he'd've told you about me and Max? _EOL_ That's right. He knew about it all... he knew for ages, and he never said a word. Enjoy your food... _EOL_ Sean? _EOL_ Tanya. _EOL_ I know you hate my guts, but you shouldn't punish Sean for it. _EOL_ I shouldn't have said what I did. _EOL_ No look...I didn't realise how much he liked you. But he really does... Please. Give him another chance will you? _EOL_ Just let him talk to you. I'm sure if you did you'd... _EOL_ You ain't exactly top prize. I'd take what I can get if I was you. _EOL_ Bit what? Classy? Expensive? _EOL_ Here. It goes with this skirt. _EOL_ Does he have to be here? _EOL_ How do you know what lap dancers wear? _EOL_ It's a designer label. ‚S forty five. _EOL_ Nothing like a bit of bonding, is there? _EOL_ Have you got our bacon rolls ready? _EOL_ No, we've got a stall to run. See you later. _EOL_ He can't have said that? _EOL_ Why would he say that? _EOL_ Don't be stupid. _EOL_ Nan, my marriage only fell apart only a few weeks ago. _EOL_ You really think Steven's good boyfriend material? He ain't exactly _EOL_ Oi Steven. Why have you been telling people I'm your girlfriend? My Nan heard you. _EOL_ Are you sure? _EOL_ Maybe he was coming onto you then. _EOL_ Well it's alright, I thought it was funny. _EOL_ Mum, you only did this last night. The whole place is spotless. Mum? Mum, will you turn it off? It's doing my head in! _EOL_ No I come back to get my phone. It's dead out there anyway. _EOL_ Oh yeah? Why am I in this mess then? Can't even afford to buy new stock. _EOL_ You just need to find something to keep you busy - apart from me. You're driving me mad! _EOL_ yeah well I'm not a kid anymore mum. I can take care of myself. _EOL_ Nan! What are you doing? _EOL_ What's the rush? _EOL_ You wanna get them waxed anyway. Get rid of that horrible stubble. Not that anyone's gonna be running their hands over your veiny pins in a hurry. _EOL_ Final demand for my pitch. I can't pay it. _EOL_ End of the day. It's a joke. _EOL_ Then what? I've got a stall with nothing to sell. Well done mum. _EOL_ No thanks. I'm alright. _EOL_ I might not have a stall tomorrow. But don't worry, don't put yourself out on my account. Everyone round here knows. I ain't worth it! _EOL_ Something smart? You come to the wrong place then. I specialise in trash no one wants to be seen dead in. _EOL_ I'm going under anyway. I thought I might as well have a bit of fun while I'm at it. _EOL_ Mum... _EOL_ You really don't have to do this... _EOL_ yes, I know Mum but.... _EOL_ Come on ladies. Take a look! Everything 50% off! And if you don't like the discount - make me an offer. _EOL_ That's a fiver darlin'. They're two for fifteen quid. You don't get that down the High Street. _EOL_ Oh Nan, Halloween's in October you know! _EOL_ Oh Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. _EOL_ Might stretch to a drink in the Vic. This has gotta cover next month. _EOL_ No. I owed a lot of back rent n'all. This just takes me back to square one. _EOL_ Looks like you might be needing that drink. See you later. _EOL_ Thanks Mum. _EOL_ Getting me out of trouble. _EOL_ He said he doesn't need the money till Friday. he seems impressed I'm getting myself together. _EOL_ I knew you was up to something. Who was it? _EOL_ You must be blind or desperate. _EOL_ Never thought I'd hear you swear off blokes. I still think you're gorgeous. Even if you did pick a walking beer gut over me..... _EOL_ I'll go and get you a drink. Celebrate your new life as a Nun. _EOL_ Thought you was jacking it all in. _EOL_ Nan, that's too much information. _EOL_ Yeah, same again thanks. Mum, this is Roger. The bloke who sold me the gear. _EOL_ Know what? _EOL_ Joke's on me, innit it? Again. _EOL_ Er, just here'll do. Just past the bridge. _EOL_ Sorry. I ain't got no money. Thanks for the lift though. _EOL_ Oh no. Don't chase me. I knew I should've picked a fat one. _EOL_ Oh no, it's alright, I ain't having a drink. I'm just gonna sit for a bit. _EOL_ I can look after myself, thanks. _EOL_ No, ta. _EOL_ Good night, was it? _EOL_ Crap. _EOL_ 'Cause I was there... _EOL_ Oh it don't matter, I've had enough. _EOL_ Yeah. _EOL_ You couldn't lend us a tenner, could ya? Mini cab. I did a runner. _EOL_ Thanks Shirley. _EOL_ Yeah, it's alright, she owes me - I need an hair of the dog. _EOL_ You want another one of them? _EOL_ Oh what's it matter? Nan's got the money back now anyway. _EOL_ What he's going to do? Go to the police? Got enough money to go out tonight now. _EOL_ Not that it is any of your business, I'm going to R & R and then wherever's still open - _EOL_ Have you skipped a pill or something? I'm not six years old anymore. _EOL_ I'm a nineteen year old screw-up and when I need cheering up I don't play flipping board games - I go out and get more wasted than I already am. _EOL_ This ain't going fast enough. Right, get me three more next time. Come on line ‚em up. _EOL_ Three more, please. _EOL_ Like I've been hit by a truck. _EOL_ I'm alright. _EOL_ What you talking about? _EOL_ Who said that? _EOL_ Don't I? _EOL_ Only reason ‚your Stace' went to that club was to get off _EOL_ Do you want me say it again then? what bit didn't you understand? _EOL_ Maybe you don't know me then mum. _EOL_ I'm not an addict, I just fancied it alright. Everything's fine now anyway, so why don't you forget about it,and move on. _EOL_ Yeah,rocking mum. _EOL_ My way seemed better. _EOL_ Well I didn't, so why don't you all just back off. _EOL_ And what would you have done? Eh? Made me a cup of tea and put the snooker on? Would've fixed me up a treat. _EOL_ I prefer it here. _EOL_ There's nothing to do mum. I'm just going to lay in this bed til they tell me I can go home. No big deal. _EOL_ Another life? _EOL_ This one ain't doing me much good is it? _EOL_ I didn't say that. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Maybe it's not that I can't fight mum. Maybe it's there nothing worth fighting for. _EOL_ Mum... _EOL_ Think the doctors might have _EOL_ Mum! _EOL_ Mum I'm not very well. _EOL_ Get off me!! I just want to lay here alright! And nothing you can do or say is going to change that. So why don't you just go away. You're about as much use as Uncle Charlie. _EOL_ Do me a favour. _EOL_ Is this going anywhere? _EOL_ Just, give it a rest, Mum this isn't what you do. _EOL_ Round and round. In one big circle you mean? Getting absolutely nowhere. _EOL_ By going skating? _EOL_ I wasn't looking for answers. _EOL_ No idea. _EOL_ Make it sound so easy. _EOL_ Thanks. _EOL_ Easy? That's not my style. _EOL_ Mum... Mum, just listen. Alright? Mum... Calm down... I'm fine. I've just got stuff I need to do. I'll call you after. Don't call me because I won't answer. Do you understand? _EOL_ You've got two choices. One you let me in. Two I stand out here, all day if I have to, and screaming my head off about our mutual friend Max. Where shall we start? his kissing technique? _EOL_ I'm not leaving til you tell me where he is. _EOL_ He's still my husband. _EOL_ Let's give him the choice then shall we? _EOL_ I need to see him Rachel, there's things I need him to hear. _EOL_ You've got no right to interfere. It's between me and him. And no one else. _EOL_ He wouldn't not tell you. _EOL_ So where would he go? Friends, Relatives, who? _EOL_ There must be someone. _EOL_ He's still my husband. _EOL_ Just so you know. I'm going to find him. _EOL_ They're Bradley's clothes. _EOL_ So you have seen him. _EOL_ When was he here? _EOL_ What d'you want me to do Rachel? Beg? _EOL_ I just wanna talk to him. Please. That's all I want. _EOL_ That's not me--- _EOL_ I just wanna give him something...I'm not expecting anything back, I just want to give him this one thing. _EOL_ I want him to have this. _EOL_ I'm trying to say sorry. _EOL_ I just wanna see if that's it between me and Bradley I wanna know if it's over Completely. _EOL_ I want to hear it from him. I want to see it in his eyes. That's he happy without me, that he can let go and move on. I might not be able to but at least I'll know that he's alright. _EOL_ So he's happy? _EOL_ There isn't anything. _EOL_ I don't want your sympathy. I just want you to understand that the only person you need to protect Bradley from is Max. Not me. _EOL_ Right...I might as well go then. _EOL_ I just hope you're right, about Bradley being happy. Because if he's not then you're not helping him. He's just gonna get sadder and sadder. You Think you can live with that? _EOL_ Hello. _EOL_ OK. Right. Well...the _EOL_ Actually it was my Mum. Who made me think. I know she's... Not always with it or whatever... It's probably the only bit of good advice she's ever really given me I think... _EOL_ I'm sorry. _EOL_ I didn't say it right though, did I Bradley? And I can't stop thinking... You are always in my head. _EOL_ ... Round and round; How you are. Who you're with. Where you are. What stupid ring tone you've got. It's pathetic. And If you ain't bothered then you ain't bothered. I can't exactly blame you. But I can't let go. And that's the new bit... I miss you. And I just thought you should know. _EOL_ OK. _EOL_ You want to have a look inside. _EOL_ Give us credit Bradley. It ain't bunny boiler stuff or nothing... I was just talking to your Mum, about me and you having a day out... _EOL_ ... I know it's stupid now. But that's what I was thinking... _EOL_ ...Just so we could talk just you and me. Just to see... _EOL_ Anyway it doesn't matter cos she said you wouldn't miss work and you wouldn't go with me. And you'd already seen all the sights in London when you were a kid. But I found these. Online. If you don't want to come you could always flog it. _EOL_ Dr. Who convention... _EOL_ Yes I know I spent my own money on two tickets to go in the tardis... and there's original costumes... And a mask. And a talk. And at twelve o'clock the aliens are gonna come down the steps of St. Paul's. _EOL_ Yeah whatever. If you change your mind... _EOL_ I'm sorry I'm an idiot... I'm Sorry. . _EOL_ You came. _EOL_ Yeah... Yeah. Come on. _EOL_ ... Don't tell me you don't know how a Dalek works. _EOL_ Come on _EOL_ What is it? _EOL_ What is it _EOL_ Bradley. _EOL_ Does your girlfriend know you're here? _EOL_ The the girl, that was at your house this morning. _EOL_ Listen... I know I got no right to barge back in your life and expect you to drop whoever... _EOL_ I don't want to make things worse. _EOL_ She sounds perfect. _EOL_ I never meant to send you mental... I... _EOL_ It... _EOL_ Sorry. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Bradley Listen. Please. I am an idiot. And sex... It is just sex... .. Any bloke who's been round the block enough any normal man... Well the likelihood is he is going to know what works and stuff... _EOL_ ... And the likelihood is that by the time he's got it sussed, he will be forty odd with a mid-life crisis, a major ego and a bald head, Bradley. I know. _EOL_ Being close. Sleeping... It's not about the ‚earth moving' or what goes where. You can learn that out of a book... ...It's about going to sleep safe... Waking up safe. And I took that for granted and now it's gone... I don't like life without you Bradley. I don't like it. _EOL_ ...I think Austria, the mountains, it's really peaceful... _EOL_ ...And I want to go on safari and see a lion... _EOL_ All them places to see.. I've always fancied swimming with dolphins... _EOL_ It's not just... It's for me too... Us. Don't you want that? _EOL_ I don't really mind where we go. Not really... We could spend two weeks in a tent in Boulogne and then go back to the flat... And that's alright at least we'll know... One day... I do still think you'll be a really good Dad. _EOL_ I love you. _EOL_ Oh That is so naff... Thank you. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ I'm sorry. _EOL_ ... I've already said .... _EOL_ No. _EOL_ No... Please... Oh please please God... _EOL_ No. Why? _EOL_ Wouldn't my name have come up? _EOL_ Not it weren't me. What did it say? _EOL_ And did you reply? _EOL_ Least someone cares for you. How are you anyway? _EOL_ Bradley wants a divorce. _EOL_ Bradley? _EOL_ What are you doing back here? _EOL_ No, not yet. Give us a chance. _EOL_ What do you want? _EOL_ About what? _EOL_ Carl - any chance? What d'you want then, a coffee? _EOL_ It's a bit early for me. _EOL_ Why are you buying me drinks? _EOL_ So what's this about? _EOL_ Somebody told me there was no fault divorce these days. _EOL_ Look I'm sorry, Tanya. _EOL_ I've got enough going on right now. This wasn't a very good idea. _EOL_ Look at that. It shouldn't be allowed. _EOL_ I caught her sleeping rough this morning. _EOL_ Told her to get lost. _EOL_ What, you think I want her nicking my stock? _EOL_ 'Cause I don't like disappointment. _EOL_ A pound for a pound? _EOL_ Yeah? _EOL_ Oh, he never said. _EOL_ And all the money's going to charity is it? _EOL_ Which is a pen and a bit of paper? _EOL_ Ohhhh. _EOL_ What, like telling Uncle Charlie? _EOL_ What's this? _EOL_ Hello. _EOL_ Oh did he? Always said he was a soft touch. _EOL_ I'm sure you will. _EOL_ Wallet still there, is it? _EOL_ Look I'm saying watch out for her, that's all. _EOL_ And why have you got to be the one that rescues her? _EOL_ Yeah. Thank Steven. _EOL_ I got guilted into it by Mother Teresa here. Oi, I know how many bits of soap there are up there, alright? _EOL_ Oi. Fancy a coffee? _EOL_ I was going to say was ﬁLunch. In the Vicﬂ. So there. My shout. _EOL_ Don't get all gooey, it's only a pie and a pint. You can owe me. _EOL_ Yeah well, you live and learn, eh? Drink up, I'll get another one in. _EOL_ What? She's a thieving little toe-rag! _EOL_ Oh get a grip. She took you for a mug and there's nothing you can do about it, so get over it. _EOL_ Yeah. Off her head, on crack. You can't just go taking in any old odds and sods... You might end up stuck with them. Now drink up and I'll beat this lot to the bar. _EOL_ Yeah well we all need something. Where you been lately, anyway? _EOL_ Right, that's his dating profile. And if he gets any messages they come up there. As long as whoever don't turn their broadband off. _EOL_ I'm not that desperate Nan. _EOL_ I thought you was working. _EOL_ You're doing my head in... bringing me chips. I was a cow to you... _EOL_ You should be looking after number one. It's tough out there. _EOL_ And it's really sweet of you, but that's what I'm saying. Maybe you should stop trying so hard... _EOL_ See? I told you she was long gone. _EOL_ How d'you work that one out, Einstein. She still took half your money. _EOL_ Yeah. That she's a stupid cow, as well as a lying little tea-leaf. What, d'you think that saw the light? There ain't no light. _EOL_ Like a dog with a bone, you are. _EOL_ Why you trying to offload it on to me then? _EOL_ In what? The power of the battered sausage? _EOL_ Well you see, my trouble is, I live in Walford, and you live in Cloud Cuckoo Land. _EOL_ Just eat your chips. _EOL_ No ta, I'm goNNA run a bath. Gotta go to the wholesalers early. Thanks for the chips. _EOL_ Yeah. We are. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Let's hope your pictures are better than your chat up lines. Come and see my etchings? _EOL_ Not me. _EOL_ Wake up, get up, go to work, earn a pittance. Spend it on stuff that I think makes me feel better. But it don't. Then I start all over again. _EOL_ That is life, Steven. _EOL_ Let me think. No. _EOL_ Serving posh suits? No thanks. _EOL_ Strangely, no... _EOL_ Know when people say you're weird? They're right. _EOL_ These are good. _EOL_ What's she said? _EOL_ My Mum. _EOL_ What? Well you shouldn't have. _EOL_ Look I wanted to be a sheep in the school Nativity. I grew out of that ‚n all. _EOL_ Into the real world Steven to earn my hundred quid. _EOL_ Oh, just leave it, will you? You might still believe in angels, ‚n pixies an' fairies and happily ever afters. But I don't. Alright? I don't. _EOL_ Steven, I don't want to talk to you so just leave me alone. Oh you alright, mum? I've just come back for some breakfast. D'you want some? _EOL_ No-one. Mum. Leave it. Mum. _EOL_ I told you. I never contacted them. I'm not going. _EOL_ Mum. It was Steven who done this. He done it behind my back. _EOL_ You wanna know why he's done this? You wanna know what he's really after? _EOL_ Look. Look. There is loads of them. He's been watching me, and drawing me. That is one step off of stalking Mum. _EOL_ Mum! _EOL_ Cuppa tea please. _EOL_ What do you think you're doing, going behind my back. _EOL_ I don't care. I'm not going. _EOL_ What and have all them college people sneering at me cos I got a market stall? I haven't even got GCSE's. _EOL_ I'm not interested. Why don't you stop sticking your nose in. _EOL_ Thanks mum. _EOL_ Willo you knock it on the head. I know exactly what you're after. _EOL_ What. You want me to spell it out? _EOL_ The drawings you done of me. _EOL_ Yeah I've seen them. _EOL_ Why shouldn't I? Don't make out I'm the weirdo. I thought we were mates. But you're all the same, aren't you. Make out you care, but you're only after one thing. _EOL_ Now what? _EOL_ How was I to know that? _EOL_ I'm not doing that course. _EOL_ If you keep feeding me chips, I'm gonna be a size twenty. _EOL_ Mum, I ain't even started pinning yet. _EOL_ Yeah but the Open Day's tomorrow and the rate I'm going you can forget about catwalks. There's no point even going. _EOL_ Say what? _EOL_ Hang on, mum. _EOL_ No, mum.. _EOL_ Mum, stop! That's really kind and everything but.... _EOL_ No. Course not... _EOL_ No, mum, listen, I love us doing things together. Honest. Actually there is something you can do. You can cover the stall for Mo while she goes to the wholesaler? _EOL_ Yeah. Please mum. _EOL_ Like that's ever gonna happen. _EOL_ Sean? What you doing here? _EOL_ What're you looking at them for? _EOL_ Has something happened _EOL_ No. I just can't believe it, that's all! _EOL_ Tanya dumping you! Her taking Max back... after everything? That's crazy! I tell you what. That man is incredible. All he has to do is come on with the chat and he gets whatever he wants. You wait - six months and it'll be like nothing ever happened! They'll all be playing happy families again. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'PHIL': \"Yes? _EOL_ So? _EOL_ Why? What've I got to worry about? _EOL_ Come again? _EOL_ Thanks. _EOL_ What the--? _EOL_ What're you doing? _EOL_ Seeing your bloke later? _EOL_ Jack then. _EOL_ Look, I couldn't care what you pair get up to, long as he ain't distracted from the real business in hand. _EOL_ Finding Louise. So when you see him, make sure that's top of his agenda... _EOL_ I'm not asking. You're a member of this family. So's Louise. You do what you have to do to get her home. _EOL_ Not yet. _EOL_ Where's your mate? Youneed sorting out. _EOL_ How much have you had? _EOL_ Drink. How much have you had to drink? _EOL_ You're gonna embarrass yourself. _EOL_ And why should you, eh? _EOL_ Why d'you bring me in here? _EOL_ I'm in the middle of a funeral - _EOL_ Yeah?... ...I'm just picking up a car from Dave Stanway's - _EOL_ It's a much better photo. _EOL_ No... I just sat outside the flat in the car... _EOL_ I dunno... didn't have a plan... just wanted to see her again. _EOL_ She's living in some poxy little flat. She should be here... _EOL_ ...With me. With her brother. _EOL_ To see her with my own eyes. _EOL_ So I'll talk to Lisa. _EOL_ Like to see her try. _EOL_ She won't get a chance. _EOL_ Like? _EOL_ Sniff of a lawyer, she's packing her bags. _EOL_ And she won't know I'm coming ‚til I've got my boot in her lying, cheating - _EOL_ Yeah, we just moved here from Loughton and my missus asked me to check out all the primary schools in the area... are your kids the ones with the greenbook bags?...yeah, I've seen them... come out about three, don't they?... Three fifteen. Thanks. _EOL_ Louise? You're good at catching, aren't you? _EOL_ D'you know who I am? _EOL_ Mummy Lisa? Your mummy and me, we used to be best friends. _EOL_ I'm your daddy, darlin'. I know you ain't seen me in a long time, but I swear on my life, I'm your daddy. _EOL_ You used to live with me and your Mum, d'you remember? In Walford? I'm your daddy. _EOL_ Louise, darlin', please... _EOL_ I'd got used to the idea of never seeing Louise again, never getting her back. Then he comes along and dangles her in front of me. _EOL_ What would you call it then? Jack told me to wait, but I couldn't. What father would? _EOL_ I sat there, outside the school. Wasn't sure I'd recognise her, it's been so long. But course I did. _EOL_ I talked to her... _EOL_ There was this bloke. She ran to him...called him Daddy. _EOL_ She was a baby when Lisa took her. She wouldn't know me from Adam. _EOL_ That's right. _EOL_ To her I was just some big scary man. _EOL_ Easy. _EOL_ Was he? _EOL_ So he didn't know what I was gonna find when I bowled up at her school? _EOL_ ‚Cos he did his research. Jack knew Lisa was with this bloke. That they were one big happy family. He knew Ronnie. He knew everything. _EOL_ Wake up will you? All he had to do was sit back and watch the show. See the big man fall. _EOL_ Better make it a twenty, eh? _EOL_ Got a job then, have you? Here, Roxy, why don't you get them for him? _EOL_ Give Billy here time to phone the council. Start hassling them about getting some proper housing. _EOL_ Make it four times. Squat in their office if you have to. Just get a result. Soon. _EOL_ Isn't it? _EOL_ What do you reckon? She serious about him or just enjoying pulling my chain? _EOL_ And what about him? _EOL_ No, I think it's good. She can keep an eye on him for us. Better we know what he's up to than not. What time's Jack coming over? _EOL_ You sure about that? _EOL_ I won't deck him if that's what you mean. _EOL_ What do you want? _EOL_ They're getting supplies, why? _EOL_ ‚S Pat's decision not mine. _EOL_ Yes, well, new start then, eh? Don't mess it up. _EOL_ Just enough for a suit, was there? _EOL_ Have you got a point to make cos you're starting to irritate me? _EOL_ Then learn. I ain't nurse-maiding anyone. _EOL_ I ain't lending you any money - _EOL_ You stupid little prat - you think I'm going to risk that again? _EOL_ Yes, and look how he ended up. _EOL_ You know, when you blagged 200 notes off me to keep quiet about it, I thought then, he's a cool little sod alright. Got even colder now, ain't you? _EOL_ Forget it. From now on that place is legit. No more stolen motors, no cut and shuts - you want to kill someone else, do you? _EOL_ He'd hang up as soon as you asked. It's too dangerous. The police nearly had us both the last time. _EOL_ You ask me again, I won't only have Pat kick you out of that job, I'll kick you out of that suit an all. Go on, get out of here. _EOL_ Move in tonight if you like. We'll give you an hand. _EOL_ Well, no, but if it's better for you there - _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ No more stolen motors. No cut and shuts - you want to kill someone else, do you? _EOL_ It's about Honey. Not wanting to move into Pat's. _EOL_ Yes. I'm fine. Look, let's solve this once and for all. _EOL_ Billy, you can have Ronnie's room - Ronnie, you'll have to share with Roxy. _EOL_ Or get Honey to accept Pat's offer. It's up to you. _EOL_ So all that crap you came out with last night - _EOL_ Yes, that about sums it up. _EOL_ Forget it. From now on that place is legit. No more stolen motors, no cut and shuts - you want to kill someone else, do you? _EOL_ He'd hang up as soon as you asked. It's too dangerous. The police nearly had us both the last time. _EOL_ That ain't nothing. _EOL_ What do you want? _EOL_ And that's it? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Let's not. _EOL_ You taking the long term view of all this? _EOL_ I don't own that land. _EOL_ I tell Ronnie this, it will be. That's you and her over - _EOL_ You really want to do this? _EOL_ So what are my options? _EOL_ I basically admit I sold stolen cars, cut n shuts - _EOL_ He blames me for what happened to Kevin Wicks- they were pretty close. _EOL_ No. Dougie's solid. It's just the tape and the kid. _EOL_ You saying I should make a deal? _EOL_ After making a few dozen copies for the future, yes, why the hell not? If I fold once he can do it again, go for this place next. _EOL_ No way. _EOL_ He ain't having that car lot. _EOL_ Too right I will. That's my mother's property we're talking about. The only way he'll get to keep that permanently is if I bury him in it. Right next to Darren. No-one blackmails me and gets away with it. _EOL_ I'm good. Thanks. _EOL_ Mum, can I have a word? _EOL_ It's just some papers that need a witness signature. For Ben's trust fund. Ritchie's bringing them over this afternoon. You don't mind, do you? _EOL_ He's still breathing, isn't he? _EOL_ I'm wondering what your head'll look inside out. _EOL_ Yes, Jack picked a good ‚un with you, didn't he? Enjoy it, did you? Playing me for a mug? _EOL_ And telling them what? I ain't done nothing, Darren. Ain't going to either. Not yet. _EOL_ No, I've done all that. I just need your signature. Get it back over to Ritchie. She's got to get it finalised before the weekend. _EOL_ No, it's something to do with the new tax laws, bottom line, it's saving us money. _EOL_ Yes. And down here. _EOL_ That's great, thanks. _EOL_ Absolutely. _EOL_ So call the police. _EOL_ Now? Or eventually. _EOL_ You're right. I didn't treat you with any respect. Now I know who I'm dealing with, I'll play things differently. Okay? Tape. _EOL_ That better be the only copy. You come asking for something else, you know what you'll get. _EOL_ I'll bear that in mind. _EOL_ New slate. _EOL_ Long term view. CLIFFHANGER _EOL_ What are you doing? _EOL_ Since when did you ever make a fuss over my birthday? _EOL_ Foreign. _EOL_ There's more in the cupboard. _EOL_ Dad's brother? Blimey. _EOL_ You ain't wearing one are ya. _EOL_ And I ain't even serving. _EOL_ When you wear one, I'll wear one. _EOL_ I'll think about it. _EOL_ Here y'are - put that on. _EOL_ It's alright - you done me a favour. _EOL_ She spent the night at Jack's. _EOL_ Oh Mum.... _EOL_ Mum.... _EOL_ I think we can guess who she got it off. _EOL_ What about it? _EOL_ Why should I mind? _EOL_ What did they want? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Oh yeah? _EOL_ Oh it's probably a mistake. It weren't one of them foreign call centres was it? _EOL_ It'll be a mix up. They're useless that bank. I'll speak to them. _EOL_ Oh, it's, er, great. It's terrific, only ...

You know, Rudolph, Bambi and all that... _EOL_ Don't worry about it, Jack loves it, he can eat it all. _EOL_ So there's no blueberries in it, there's no venison. Are there any shallots in it? _EOL_ I'm not. Anyway, forty-seven, fifty, it don't bother me. _EOL_ Nah. _EOL_ Ben keeps me young, keeps me on my toes. It must be same for you, with your daughter? Oh I forgot. You're not allowed to see her, are you? That must be hard for you. _EOL_ Yeah yeah. Just getting some water. _EOL_ Oh sorry mate. _EOL_ It was an accident.

You deserve it. _EOL_ He's in the loo. _EOL_ And congratulations. _EOL_ Yeah. Why? Was it supposed to be a secret? Well go easy on him. He's just excited.

And I can't even dance. _EOL_ Eh? _EOL_ Frankly my dear, I can't. I've got something planned. _EOL_ With Garry. I can't let him down, I promised him. See you later. _EOL_ Listen you can't tell her a thing about this. _EOL_ What if I buy you drinks all night? _EOL_ Yeah I'm up to my kneck. I'm drowning in it. _EOL_ Why d'you think I'm putting myself through all this? Me back's killing me. Feel like I've been run over by a juggernaut. _EOL_ Alright, I have been a bit off with her lately. I'll go an' see her. _EOL_ Oi what d'you _EOL_ Criminal damage more like. Ain't you supposed to be at school? _EOL_ You cheeky little- _EOL_ Quick enoughfor you? Give me one goodreason why I don't kick you right up the jacksie? _EOL_ Do one you lot, it's got nothing to do with you, alright. _EOL_ Gal? _EOL_ Is your Mum there? _EOL_ I need to talk to her.I've got to tell her I can't go through with it _EOL_ No Gal, I've gotta tellher I can't go through with the wedding. Gal? Gal? _EOL_ Gal? Gal! _EOL_ I think it's for the best. _EOL_ Thanks for coming. _EOL_ Look I know I've been acting a little bit strange lately. YOu know, not paying you much attention. Not coming home. _EOL_ I should've explained, I should've said something, so- _EOL_ This stupid _EOL_ An' if you're daft enough to marry me. Then I'm daft enough to do the Acheybreaky Heart - _EOL_ What's that little toerag been up to now? Him and his mates would have wrecked that whole playground yesterday if I hadn't chased them off. _EOL_ What did she say exactly? _EOL_ Why? _EOL_ What's she mean about that? _EOL_ Did you ask her? _EOL_ Alright Dawn? Everything all right with little Jay? _EOL_ Well, sort of take up with Jase, you kind of are aren't ya? _EOL_ What that a problem? _EOL_ What for? _EOL_ Oh. Right. _EOL_ I thought he was a hairdresser. _EOL_ A mechanic. _EOL_ You know the Beckhams? _EOL_ Line dancing. _EOL_ She's just trying to wind you up. _EOL_ Which means she's rattled. _EOL_ I'm telling ya, she's bricking it Haze, good and proper. _EOL_ Yeah. She was the one who asked to come see us? She wouldn't do that if she weren't worried? I'm telling you, we've got her running scared. _EOL_ What do you mean? _EOL_ What? Be as bitchy as her you mean? _EOL_ You're worth ten of her babe. _EOL_ You're skinny as a _EOL_ Oh I suppose I'm going to have to go and have a face-lift have I, so as I can look like a supermodel. _EOL_ We haven't got a problem. _EOL_ Dawn's not going to be _EOL_ Heather's our bridesmaid. _EOL_ Ain't you hungry? _EOL_ You've got to eat. _EOL_ That's months away. _EOL_ I really don't know about that - _EOL_ Me? _EOL_ She's your mate - _EOL_ Look Heather if it's too much pressure you've only got to say you know. _EOL_ Well, there's no point in making yourself ill is there? _EOL_ Look it's only one day isn't it? _EOL_ I couldn't do it. She's got her heart on it Haze. _EOL_ No of course not. _EOL_ It won't be spoilt. Are you alright? _EOL_ How can you say that, it's all she's been going on about for the past couple of months. _EOL_ What end? _EOL_ I can't wait to see that. _EOL_ What other way? _EOL_ Yeah, but - _EOL_ Oh you're not alright are you - - it's this diet innit - ? _EOL_ OK. _EOL_ OK, OK - _EOL_ ...You've got to eat something. Most important meal of the day. _EOL_ What about a piece of toast. _EOL_ But - _EOL_ I just thought you know - _EOL_ I like you the way you are. _EOL_ Er, yeah. All done. _EOL_ Yeah, she understood. _EOL_ What, sorry? _EOL_ Yeah. Maybe later. _EOL_ Gal... You haven't noticed anything...odd...about Hazel lately have you? _EOL_ Nothing, Come on, let's get to work before Phil gets on our backs. _EOL_ I've just heard. Are you alright? _EOL_ About you fainting. _EOL_ Shirley. And fainting is not ﬁnothingﬂ. And when were you gonna tell me? _EOL_ Well I am worried. I'm very worried. Look I think you and me need to have a little talk, don't we? I've noticed some changes in you recently. _EOL_ Yes. And if you can't talk to me, there are people you can talk to. _EOL_ You're the most important thing in the world to me and I can't just stand by and do nothing if there's something wrong. _EOL_ Then how do you explain the not eating and fainting. Look, if you can't admit it to yourself - _EOL_ Yeah, but it was nothing. _EOL_ Hazel's probably just a bit stressed about the wedding. _EOL_ She'll be fine. If there's anything wrong with her, the doctor's will pick up on it immediately. _EOL_ She's just gone for a check up. Make sure everything's ok. _EOL_ Yeah it is. _EOL_ No. Honest. _EOL_ Gal, Gal. She's alright. Honestly, she's not ill. _EOL_ She's pregnant. _EOL_ Gal... Listen mate, I know it's a bit unexpected all this and that. But you know, we just want you to be happy for us mate. _EOL_ Cheers...I don't think Garry's gonna come round on this one. You heard him. _EOL_ Oh no, not you an' all. _EOL_ Yeah, tell me about it. _EOL_ Honestly? _EOL_ It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'd always wanted kids, Phil. But I never thought it ever gonna happen you know. I know men can have children at any age. But once me and Hazel decided we were gonna get married, I thought that was the end of that idea. But now, all of a sudden. I can have it all. I've got a beautiful wife. I'm gonna have a kid. My own family. It's more than I ever wanted in the whole world.. _EOL_ Cheers Phil. _EOL_ There you are. I was really worried about you. I was gonna send out a search party for you. _EOL_ How'd the doctors go? You've made me so happy, I am so happy. And you know what else, you know I wasn't supposed to say nothing, well it kind of popped out and Phil knows. And Garry's not too pleased. But he'll come round. All that matters now is thatyou're gonna be a Mummy and Im _EOL_ You shouldn't be doing that. You've got precious cargo on board... I don't want you overdoing it. _EOL_ Are you still feeling sick? _EOL_ ... Now I want you to phone up Tanya and tell her you're not coming in today alright? _EOL_ Because I've been reading up on it. And babies, they don't like the stress. You see? _EOL_ I'll talk to him. _EOL_ You have it. You're eating for two now. _EOL_ I take it Dot's not back. _EOL_ Like what? _EOL_ All you've gotta do is keep Hazel busy. Alright? And then bring her to the Vic afterwards. _EOL_ So you'll do it then? _EOL_ Yeah, just go round there and keep her out the way okay? _EOL_ Okay and I'll call you. _EOL_ Well to let you know I'm done. _EOL_ I knew I could count on you. _EOL_ Thanks for this, Peggy. _EOL_ What do you think? _EOL_ Just leave it. Hazel, Hazel? Why did you just run out like _EOL_ Oh what are you sorry for? You haven't done nothing. _EOL_ You lost the baby? _EOL_ You said... _EOL_ What does that mean? _EOL_ Tea please Jane. _EOL_ Oh thanks. I'll buy you a pint later. And Gal, cheerss for giving us a bit of space over the weekend... _EOL_ No kid wants some balding old git waiting at the school gates for them do they? _EOL_ Kind of just putting a positive spin on it for Hazel's sake. I've had a couple of days to think about it...it's for the best to be honest. _EOL_ Go on. Have a good laugh. Then get lost. Leave me alone! Please! _EOL_ Well I'm not am I. You happy now? _EOL_ Cut the fake sympathy will ya Gal, and just sling your hook. _EOL_ Then why do I feel so empty Gal? _EOL_ Honestly, I'd say no thanks. Cos Hazel's my life. She's my soulmate. And I love her. And without her. I don't think I could carry on. _EOL_ Can we do this later? _EOL_ Stuff the competition, stuff the line dancing. I've got more important things to do. _EOL_ Actually, I think I might pop round and see her. There's something not quite right here. _EOL_ Look, if you don't mind, I feel like going to see my lovely finacee. if that's alright with you two? _EOL_ Right. That's it. I'm gonna go and sort this out. _EOL_ Not really, no. I've had enough of this. I'm gonna go and see what's going on. _EOL_ Where's Hazel? _EOL_ Wasn't she at the flat? _EOL_ Why didn't you bring her here then? _EOL_ Gone? What d'you mean gone? _EOL_ I don't understand.... _EOL_ She didn't say that, _EOL_ No...no, Hazel wouldn't say that. Not my Hazel. _EOL_ What's going on Gal? What's going on? I don't understand mate. You said you were gonna go and get her, you promised... _EOL_ Hazel! Don't do this please! Talk to me! Please! I love you! I love you..... _EOL_ I don't. _EOL_ Congratulations Gal. You've got what you always wanted. _EOL_ Oh but I do. There's only one person to blame for this mate... And that's you. _EOL_ Hazel...I'm Hazel, I'm here, hang on babe... _EOL_ Hazel...Pick up... Please baby'... _EOL_ Funny how your sad little life fits into two bin bags. _EOL_ I think we're finished here. So why don't you just pick up your rubbish and go. _EOL_ Not anymore we're not. _EOL_ Hazel was fine when I left her. We had a cuddle. We even had a little chat about what we were gonna have for tea. Then a few hours later she's in a taxi speeding out of my life for good. And who was the last person to see her? You! _EOL_ I don't need protecting thanks. I'm big enough and ugly enough to look after myself. And that's what I intend to do in the future. So, no more Garry and Minty. No more ﬁbest matesﬂ. I will never forgive you for this. _EOL_ Have a nice life! Keys. _EOL_ Yeah I know.It's a mess innit. But you know what? I like it. And if you've come here with some pathetic sob story from Garry, you can just do one. _EOL_ Oh here we go. Garry, clear off! And take your messenger with you! _EOL_ Some kids broke in. Made a bit of a mess. _EOL_ Look I think you might've had a bit of a wasted journey..... _EOL_ Look I'm really sorry, but there's.... _EOL_ I'm really sorry you're homeless Heather, but you ain't staying here alright? _EOL_ I ain't doing the competition anymore. I told you that last night. Didn't I? _EOL_ Not yet no. 'Cause I didn't want to get her into trouble for impersonating somebody else. _EOL_ Yeah. Until I phone them, tell 'em we've had a row. And tell 'em it's all off. Oi. _EOL_ She still loves me? _EOL_ How? _EOL_ No one knows. Yeah. Oh what have I done? He was trying to be a mate weren't he, all he was trying to do was help... _EOL_ Yeah. She really still loves me. I knew she still loved me. I never doubted it really. I've gotta go and find Garry. _EOL_ No Phil. He's the reason I'm here. Look Gal, I'm really sorry, mate. I hope you can forgive me. I know you were just trying to protect me, even at the cost of our friendship. You're are real pal mate. I'm really really sorry. And with your help right, we'll go and find Hazel and bring her back _EOL_ Yep, raring to go Boss eh? Together again, Yeah? I love you, mate. Thanks. _EOL_ What about if I work double shifts - for a month? And the weekends as well. _EOL_ That's brilliant. _EOL_ Yeah, she's er, she's homeless. But we can always talk her out of that, come on. _EOL_ It's all over. I'm sorry, Heather. I can't believe I've been so thick. _EOL_ Her. Donna. Me and Hazel met her didn't we? She's probably onto them right now, blowing our cover. We're stuffed. I can't believe it we were so close. _EOL_ I was counting down the days till I could go and find Hazel. _EOL_ It's too late. _EOL_ How much worse can you make it? _EOL_ What's the point? It's best it's over. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Hang on a minute, if they're out of it, does that mean we've won? _EOL_ Yeah, but they weren't even in the running. You know what this means, don't you? It's in the bag. We've won. _EOL_ I've rounded up as many as I could. _EOL_ No it's for Heather. _EOL_ This is for you. Not from your mum is it? _EOL_ I thought, meet in the Vic about seven. A few beers,then what? Curry? _EOL_ So it's. Buddy On Call night, tonight, alright. We're going to really go for it, alright. _EOL_ No, no, no. You won't like it. No. It's a blokes thing. Stupid boys mucking about... _EOL_ I'll talk to her, it'll be fine. _EOL_ It'll be a laugh. _EOL_ Oh come on. He didn't get many cards or anything and if you come, it'll make more of a night of it. _EOL_ Just the three of us. _EOL_ Cheers Phil. _EOL_ Oi, behave yourself, pack it in. _EOL_ Dead Arm? What's Dead Arm? _EOL_ That hurt. _EOL_ I just did. _EOL_ I reversed it. _EOL_ Pass it on. _EOL_ Yeah, it was. Garry invited her, what could I do? _EOL_ Gordon Bennett woman, she's old enough and ugly enough to look after herself ain't she. _EOL_ She is a sour faced old cow alright, she don't give a monkeys about anybody else. _EOL_ What's the big rush boss? _EOL_ Like Pinky and Perky? _EOL_ Ah, well, thanks Shirl for getting us barred from our favourite curry house. _EOL_ Come on, just leave her. _EOL_ A bit like the outside. Urgh. _EOL_ Like this probably- _EOL_ Oi oi oi! _EOL_ Oi come on, come on, look stay here - have some peanuts...? And Phil can do us a lock in hey? _EOL_ So did you have a few drinks on the plane? _EOL_ I can't I've got to look after er... _EOL_ These are Garry's so don't blame me. Connect Four... Kerplunk... _EOL_ Buckaroo. _EOL_ She's a mouthy, sour-faced, old crow, I thought we weren't gonna to mention her? _EOL_ Anyway cheer up, you're making the donkey miserable, look. _EOL_ Oh, steady, steady.. _EOL_ I don't believe you, you beat me at every single game. _EOL_ There's still the heart to go yet. Get the heart and then you win. _EOL_ Loser, loser, loser, loser! _EOL_ Okay the next one is... _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ Gal...Gus reckons that you were so ratted last night you were all over Jane like a rash. _EOL_ Let's phone her up and see. _EOL_ Hello. _EOL_ Maybe her battery's flat? _EOL_ Anyway I thought you were gonna let things lie for a couple of days? _EOL_ Well it still don't give her right to be such a cow. _EOL_ Hello, what's your name and where d'you come from? Marni? Yeah. Today? _EOL_ Take it things didn't go too well then? _EOL_ Oh well. She's a big girl, she'll get over it. _EOL_ Yeah, about that. Marni's coming over this afternoon. _EOL_ Look, I'm sorry you've fallen out but you've gotta put it behind you now, alright. You've gotta help me convince Marni that we deserve to win this wedding. Otherwise... ...you can forget about bridesmaids dresses, ‚cause we won't be needing one. _EOL_ I don't know what you think you're playing at but you ain't staying here. Alright? _EOL_ Well, I'm sorry but... _EOL_ How does someone as lovely as Heather, end up with someone like you as a mate? _EOL_ Oh? _EOL_ The Lurve Test? _EOL_ Well it was worth it weren't it, staying up all night? I feel like we probably know all there is to know about each other now. _EOL_ Oh Easy. Georgiou Michaelious. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Oi, please, please, pack it in, will you. _EOL_ Karaoke machine. _EOL_ nan _EOL_ Yes. Hazel! You cheeky little monkey. _EOL_ We won! We won! We won! _EOL_ No, it's my fault innit. I should have known better. I was just fooling myself, weren't I? _EOL_ Message? _EOL_ Heather was right. _EOL_ It was a message. I phoned round all the cruise companies. This ship was in dock at Southampton all week. It set sail for the Caribbean today. _EOL_ Is it? Look, at the postmark. This card came yesterday, right. It must've got caught up in the junk mail - if I'd seen it I could've got down there in time. _EOL_ I'll never know now, will I. I've blown it. Again. Story of my life. _EOL_ There's an idea - I could go into the Caribbean, and meet her boat when it docks. _EOL_ Yeah that's right. All I have to do is phone up Marnie, and ask her for an advance on our wedding - _EOL_ I'm going to do it. I'll phone her now. Ask Phil for the time off. I could be on my way by tomorrow. You are a genius. _EOL_ No, she is, I can feel it. It's like a...I can't explain it. It's like a love thing, you know. _EOL_ No, I know it sounds crazy but it's fate, believe me. Which is why I've got to take this. Wait, this is it. Hi Marnie. Yeah. Thanks for getting back to me so promptly. Yeah. So you got my message? Yeah about the cheeky little advance on the winnings. _EOL_ What? Oh no, you're joking. _EOL_ She says the twenty grand isn't a cash prize. It's for the wedding and the honeymoon, and they arrange all of that. Isn't there even any spending money? _EOL_ Look Mrs Trott, Heather's been a real mate, OK. Now, I was supposed to marrying Garry's mum but she kind of did a runner. Alright, now Heather stepped in and saved the day. Now if we win this wedding competition, we stand to bag a couple of grand, right. _EOL_ We've got to find some way of getting her out. _EOL_ Queenie? _EOL_ She's here. _EOL_ Agreed. _EOL_ Come on you Biddy give us a chorus. _EOL_ Two beers please. _EOL_ Oh do hurry up, we're rather parched. _EOL_ Still no sign of your bird, Queenie? _EOL_ Dunno what you're talking about. _EOL_ Yeah I know. We're trying to get rid of her, but Heather wants her to stay. _EOL_ Not really. She's horrible to her. _EOL_ Heather, this can't go on. _EOL_ She can go back to her flat any time she wants. _EOL_ What? Are you scared of her? Does she hurt you? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'CHRISTIAN': \"Lesley! I'm really glad about this. You must be Ian. _EOL_ This is my partner, Ashley. _EOL_ What a lovely little place. _EOL_ So now that you've seen her in the flesh, Ashley, how does Lesley compare with the way I described her? _EOL_ I keep on forgetting Lesley changed her name. What would your therapist bloke make of that? _EOL_ He might say it indicates an attempt to run away from something...But let's not go into that now. _EOL_ In amongst other things. _EOL_ My sister and I have what's called a love/hate relationship. I love her, she hates me - isn't that right, Jane? And I do. Love her that is. Very very much. It breaks my heart that she.... _EOL_ Can we have a bottle of your very best champagne, please? And before you start counting the pennies, Jane, we're paying, ain't we, Ash? _EOL_ You know, Ian, you're exactly as I imagined. Did I say, Ash? The kind of bloke Jane would end up marrying? I mean David was always going to be a tough act to follow, but my word, I think she's found him. _EOL_ Yeah. Very well. _EOL_ Me and Ash? Hampstead Heath. _EOL_ No, it's just we're not really allowed to say, are we? _EOL_ Well the authorities take a very dim view of probation officers dating their clients. _EOL_ Well you certainly act like my probation officer. You're being very quiet, Jane. _EOL_ Sorry - I'll shut up. _EOL_ Of course I'm nervous. I haven't seen her in how long? When did David die? _EOL_ So it has to be at least a year before that then. Do you still think of him? _EOL_ So do I. _EOL_ He's _EOL_ It's really over, he weren't kidding. _EOL_ I did like him Jane, I'd just had a few too many drinks. _EOL_ So I took security over passion. But you'd know all about that. _EOL_ I'm sure you do, in your own way. So this is where you work every day? _EOL_ I'm not sure if that's better or worse. _EOL_ I've got nowhere to stay. _EOL_ Just for a week or two. I've got nowhere else to go. No money, no nothing. I'm glad this has happened with Ashley. It'll give us a chance to get to know each other all over again. You're not still mad at me about David, are ya? _EOL_ Hi, I'm Christian. Jane's brother. _EOL_ So you've heard of me? _EOL_ No. I can't believe you come from the same gene pool as him. You're a very handsome man and quite frankly he's... not. _EOL_ You have the most incredible eyes. _EOL_ Is she? _EOL_ Oh right. _EOL_ Oh it's lovely. I love the decor. _EOL_ Ah thanks. You won't regret it. _EOL_ Thanks Ian. So you don't mind me sharing a bed with you and Jane then? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Ian getting hot under the collar, is he? _EOL_ Bet he's got all the rules written down somewhere. Laminated. _EOL_ I was joking. _EOL_ How can you stand it? Earth to Jane? Don't touch the tuna mayonnaise mate. Affects the hearing. _EOL_ What's it about? _EOL_ Bet you do - _EOL_ Yeah, it's so much fun. _EOL_ What? And they didn't invite me? _EOL_ The anticipation's killing me. _EOL_ You are so nineteen eighties. _EOL_ Into - Ian. Someone, shoot me now. _EOL_ You make him sound like a Labrador. Except Labradors are cute. _EOL_ Less Captain Corelli, more - Captain Pugwash. _EOL_ Just telling you it how I see it. When was the last time you had any fun? _EOL_ It's worse than I thought. I don't care what his Majesty says. Tonight, you are coming out with me. _EOL_ Anyone I know walks in, I'm emigrating. _EOL_ Wondered where it all kicked off round here. _EOL_ I promised I'd take Jane out. _EOL_ I bet you are. We can still have a drink. If you don't mind sharing? _EOL_ Only, this sister of yours, the one you're not speaking to. Don't suppose we could get her to do me a favour? _EOL_ Being up to your elbows in dirty dish water is? _EOL_ None whatsoever. _EOL_ Brothers, sisters. All just want the best for each other, don't we? _EOL_ You should come out more often. _EOL_ Do you love him? Really? _EOL_ What you drinking? _EOL_ So, if Ian's your dream man. Why all the romantic fiction? _EOL_ Know what I reckon? I reckon, whatever you say,you're still waiting for your, ‚Officer and a Gentleman'? _EOL_ Kieron. He's an ex of mine. _EOL_ I used to look up to you. D'you know that? You were the first to get away. I thought you were gonna really do something. Be someone. I was so jealous. Then I turn up here and find you hitched to Mr.Bean. What happened?! _EOL_ Even so darlin' - Ian? _EOL_ Your knight in shining armour. _EOL_ And what about Grant? The way he made you feel. Inside. Ian ever make you feel like that? _EOL_ I know he was a soldier. Bet he was buff. Hungry, passionate. _EOL_ Was it any good? _EOL_ I'm going for a run. Then I'll be back to collect my stuff - _EOL_ How many wives is it again, Ian? Think you've got it all worked out, don't you? Jane running round skivying after you - _EOL_ Yeah? What book's she reading? _EOL_ Jane's gonna wake up one day, smell the coffee and realise what she's been missing. Then she'll be out of here. Just like all the rest. _EOL_ No. But there's a Dodo at number forty-five. _EOL_ Okay...How much do you pay for that hair? _EOL_ Looks like it. No name polo shirt, beginnings of a paunch. _EOL_ So, you don't work out. Spend precious little on presentation. Seriously. Don't you ever wonder what it is Jane sees in you? _EOL_ I don't believe it, there's actually people round here who smile. Tell your husband, bottle it, he'll make a fortune. _EOL_ If that's all that was going on last night I'm never looking after those kids again. _EOL_ Is that a twenty? _EOL_ It's just - _EOL_ - from this angle - _EOL_ Panic? _EOL_ I would. You turn up with food for twenty and a room full of two hundred, you'll have a riot on your hands. _EOL_ Ten times more. _EOL_ Alright. Just trying to be helpful. _EOL_ Don't bite my head off. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ ‚Course. _EOL_ Don't take it out on Jane. _EOL_ Know what I think? _EOL_ I think you need the Fire Brigade. _EOL_ Well we can't lift it up - or get your hand out even if we could. _EOL_ Rox - _EOL_ I need you. Now. _EOL_ Knew there was something we'd forgot. _EOL_ Do us a favour. Leave him down there. _EOL_ The creature from the deep. _EOL_ You tell us. _EOL_ At stuffing vol-au-vents? _EOL_ I'll pay. Whatever it costs. Just don't tell anyone. _EOL_ Well go on then, ask me- _EOL_ How I got on - - yesterday, Christian the outside caterer? _EOL_ After all our hard work, you don't want to know? _EOL_ That's nice - Well it was. _EOL_ How did she do that? _EOL_ Oh. _EOL_ Accidents happen babe. _EOL_ Nothing at all. _EOL_ Off anywhere nice? _EOL_ Have you seen Roxy? _EOL_ That she was getting away. _EOL_ Mood she was in, the dark side of the Moon wouldn't be far enough. _EOL_ I got the distinct impression it'd take more than a mended necklace to bring her round. _EOL_ Hidden depths, hasn't he? _EOL_ Here's me thinking that husband of yours was a retro throwback to the dark ages when all the time - _EOL_ We had a good long talk last night. _EOL_ We're getting together, Jane. _EOL_ You knew I was looking for something to do. _EOL_ I saw the money you were raking in yesterday and that was just from a Council do. When some of my friends start enjoy themselves - _EOL_ A union. Not sure about the long. _EOL_ Did you get hold of her? Rox? _EOL_ Depends on what you want. _EOL_ Are you OK? Are you gonna tell me what that was all about? _EOL_ ...But if it's over between them, why upset Ronnie any more by telling her? _EOL_ Depends. _EOL_ On why it is you're telling her. If it's to warn her off making the same mistake again, fine. But if it's just to ease your conscience... _EOL_ It's a gift. _EOL_ So promise me you're not gonna say anything? _EOL_ As long as it's not illegal this time. _EOL_ Well definitely count me in. What did you have in mind? _EOL_ You're on. _EOL_ You are joking. _EOL_ Someone's certainly perked up from earlier. Good job too. _EOL_ So where's it to be? Vauxhall? Soho? What do you reckon? Rox? _EOL_ ...Three phone numbers. Not bad for a night's work. But you've either got it or you ain't. _EOL_ I'll not be calling ﬁTimﬂ. He'll be back home with his wife by now. _EOL_ Haven't we been through this. _EOL_ I'll tell you what I told you last night. Charging over there all guns blazing is not the answer. _EOL_ She won't thank you for it. People always shoot the messenger. _EOL_ Fine. Have it out with Jack. But not in this state. _EOL_ Just finished the business plan. _EOL_ What's wrong with it? _EOL_ It's fun. It's the image we're looking for. Plus, it's too late, the business cards are already printed up... _EOL_ ...and we should be making a killing in no time. _EOL_ Great. What is it? Wedding? Corporate do? _EOL_ Stinks in here. _EOL_ And there was me thinking we were heading for the glamorous end of the market. _EOL_ What? That's not even in the budget! _EOL_ First rule of business Ian. Never offer more than you can deliver. _EOL_ You mean gay. _EOL_ You are joking. _EOL_ What about the food? There is no way I'm touching your cheesey hedgehogs. _EOL_ Oi! Roxy! Where you going? _EOL_ Ian's lumbered me with some kid's party while he swans off to brown nose at some council lunch. _EOL_ Just this mate of mine's got a mobile disco. Strobe lighting. Dry ice. The lot. Just need the jeep to pick it up. _EOL_ Well what about karaoke? Bingo? _EOL_ Help me then. Come on. Ian's really dropped me in it. _EOL_ Where the hell's Ian? We need the food. Now! _EOL_ He got you to do it? Cheeky git! _EOL_ Good! This was your job. Not hers! _EOL_ Never mind interest. How many bookings did you get exactly? _EOL_ We're not gonna get very far then are we? Cos you don't get on with anyone. _EOL_ To sort this mess out before we commit professional suicide. _EOL_ Good isn't it? _EOL_ I'm multi-talented Jane. Ian doesn't know how lucky he is having me as a partner. _EOL_ Thought Ian might enjoy the sight of Jeph in his boxer shorts. Bring out his repressed tendencies... _EOL_ I couldn't resist it. Did you see the look on his face? _EOL_ Come off it Jane. It was just a wind up. Nothing happened if that's what you're worried about. _EOL_ Ok, ok...I'll be a good boy in future. I promise. _EOL_ Oh yeah. Look, I'm sorry for using the last of the coffee. I'll get some more while I'm out. _EOL_ I'm sure it is - trouble being, I've got to spend the afternoon looking for somewhere to stay. _EOL_ That's all I wanted to hear. Shall we hug it out? _EOL_ Hi, nice to meet you. _EOL_ Ian. Can't it wait? _EOL_ No. _EOL_ Yeah, me too. _EOL_ Yeah, you've got a _EOL_ Spare us the details. _EOL_ Could still be bi. _EOL_ So have you thought about what you're wearing tonight? _EOL_ Ian, it's important. You wanna make the right impression. _EOL_ Which one? _EOL_ Nice. The same outfit that attracted him to you in the first place. You see, he pretends not to care but he's getting the hang of it already. _EOL_ Yeah, mine. It's nice, isn't it? _EOL_ And remember, if you can't be good, be careful. _EOL_ I'm not saying pink everything. I'm saying pink tablecloths, pink menus and pink napkins. That's it. _EOL_ Ian. _EOL_ Did you see this in the letter? _EOL_ From Tunstall's office. He's expecting silver service. _EOL_ We're gonna have to get in agency staff. _EOL_ Can't be helped. _EOL_ What was all that about? _EOL_ It's ironic. _EOL_ A post-modern starter. _EOL_ That's the difference between you and me, Ian. If I told you it'd make people laugh, would you understand that? _EOL_ AND...it's pink. _EOL_ Dave - I met a Dave. But where? _EOL_ He might be good looking. I was just thinking about you. Not particularly. How's things? I should think so. Remind me now. Which club was it we met? Oh right. Saturday night, you say? Let me just consult the old diary. Am I single? That all depends. _EOL_ Am I being asked out on a date here? _EOL_ OK - tell you what - seeing as it's nearby, why don't you call for me? Can I give you the address of where I'm staying? _EOL_ You two need to learn to keep your voices down. _EOL_ I heard all of that. You want rid of me. _EOL_ What kind of opportunity? _EOL_ You're offering me a place? _EOL_ And smart, is it? _EOL_ Where is it, exactly? _EOL_ So? _EOL_ So, where are all of the fit men you promised me? Only reason I came. _EOL_ He's cute. _EOL_ They always do. Nothing a few drinks won't fix. Where's Ian? _EOL_ At this time of night? Bet I know what he's really up to. Making the flat more welcoming? Installing some ventilation perhaps. _EOL_ Long as they're on the house. _EOL_ Now this is what I call a party. _EOL_ A few alterations I'd like you to make to the flat, before I put pen to paper. As a paying tenant... _EOL_ As a paying tenant, you couldn't possibly expect me to live there in its current state. _EOL_ Whistling merrily? Spontaneous acts of affection? Sounds like another woman to me! _EOL_ Hello? _EOL_ What is? _EOL_ Yeah well, it comes to everyone. Not me, obviously, but, everyone else. _EOL_ The kitchen tap leaks. _EOL_ I think, if you check the terms of the tenancy agreement... _EOL_ Thanks. And you haven't forgotten we're tasting wines later. _EOL_ Great. You thought about jogging? _EOL_ How often? _EOL_ A week? _EOL_ You should. It's good for stress. _EOL_ You called the plumber? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Because she notices things like that. _EOL_ Okay. When? _EOL_ How are you doing? _EOL_ Great. Let's have some squat thrusts. Say... twenty? _EOL_ One, two, come on, three, four... _EOL_ So how are those lungs doing? _EOL_ Really? _EOL_ Okay. _EOL_ You have aching teeth? Come on, tiger. That's enough for one day. Last one home's a cissy. _EOL_ Unless you're too _EOL_ Come on you. _EOL_ Don't forget to stretch your teeth. _EOL_ Pouille Fuisse. It's French. _EOL_ Of course you did. _EOL_ Plumber coming? _EOL_ Probably his achy breaky teeth. _EOL_ And you're suppose to spit. _EOL_ Way too many jokes.... _EOL_ No problem ... Thanks a lot... Bye. _EOL_ Better than you, hopalong. _EOL_ Maybe he bumped into Clare on the way? _EOL_ You know. Just thought you might wanna give your Silver Service a last minute brush up? _EOL_ Because you failed to mention that your grotty flat has no washing machine. And I'm still waiting for a plumber for the tap by the way. _EOL_ No you're alright. It's all under control here. Just a few last minute checks. _EOL_ No, okay. Yeah, ‚course I will. _EOL_ Our business, ‚cause, unfortunately for me, we're in it together... _EOL_ Yeah... the wine's ordered, last few guests invited, oh the band's booked, 4,381 pounds 67 pence spent. _EOL_ If they had a venue to turn up to. _EOL_ Which is why I didn't check it until now. You booked it for next Friday instead of this one. Still, I suppose we can always have a street party in February, you moron. _EOL_ Yeah well, you best let me deal with Edward. _EOL_ Weare not going to tell him anything, because wecan't be trusted, can we? Except perhaps to take ones pants to the launderette, and I wouldn't be _EOL_ Yeah, didn't take long to come up with a shortlist. _EOL_ Edward's fine about it! _EOL_ He thinks it's ‚cool', less stuffy than a hotel. All we had to do was cancel the band, book a DJ, work up a buffet menu... _EOL_ Yeah, well it was either that or your knackers on a plate. But I covered for you, so... Daddy can get back to plucking his eyebrows now, can't he? _EOL_ Yay! _EOL_ Oh yeah, nothing like the cheery glow of home after a long, hard day. Forget larging it in some hotel, gourmet dinner, hot tub... _EOL_ I could have talked them into it. Another triumph for hubby. So he finally got a plumber over! Big deal. _EOL_ And the bed's going over there. Kingsize, obviously, for when I'm entertaining. And I'd better put a proper hob in, so Noah can have his back... _EOL_ Nah, you don't wanna do that. _EOL_ What, and undo all your good work? Be good for him. Treat him mean, keep him keen. Or just for the fun of it. _EOL_ Oh, there must be something good to say about him! _EOL_ Yeah, you're right, there's nothing. _EOL_ Yeah, no cure for what you've got with hubby I'm afraid. _EOL_ Love, dummy! Come on. Let's get you home. _EOL_ Check. _EOL_ Check. _EOL_ In little pots. People love that sort of thing. It's ironic. Remember? Post-modern, self-referencing....Just, leave it with us... _EOL_ Being delivered straight to the club. Aren't they? _EOL_ Can we get some more glasses over the other side. _EOL_ Glass of prosecco? You're late. _EOL_ Grab some canapes and start doing the rounds - and Steven? Smile. _EOL_ Oh dear, where's Dorothy gone? Taken Toto back to Kansas? _EOL_ So why was he wearing a frock? _EOL_ What fashion? _EOL_ You don't think it's a bit ‚dressing up box'? Sorry. It's what you like that counts. I mean forget I said anything. _EOL_ Depends on who you like. Valentino, Balenciaga... Designers... Have a look at this, might give you some ideas. _EOL_ Looking at somewhere between fifty and seventy covers. _EOL_ What you wanna do cheese on sticks in the pub for the rest of your life? _EOL_ We take it on, we'll make it happen. We'll get Clare on board again. _EOL_ And when they do, I wanna be ready to hit the ground running. I think sounding Clare out is a good idea. _EOL_ We've got someone on our doorstep like her, it's stupid not to take advantage. _EOL_ Clare? _EOL_ Because he's a wimp. _EOL_ Yeah well you said it. So what did he say then? ‚Sorry Janey Waney'. _EOL_ Yeah well, tonight, me and you we're going out. Leave Walford's new Stud Muffin to it. Kids, tea, bedtime all of it. _EOL_ Oh come on. No strippers this time, alright. Just me and you getting on it and having a giggle. Come on. Get all glammed up, you've got me to draw the blokes in, you never know, might even pull? _EOL_ What? Good for the goose and all that. _EOL_ Ian with her? _EOL_ Men don't own up unless something's gonna come out. _EOL_ Go snog the face off the nearest bloke? _EOL_ Drinks on me all night if you snog one of that lot. _EOL_ Yeah maybe not. Last thing you need's a knock back. _EOL_ What ‚these days?' _EOL_ He's only toying _EOL_ What? I unearth a secret admirer- _EOL_ All I want is for you to wake up and start having some fun that's all. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ I'm sorry - but that coming from ‚Mrs Ian Beale?' Fairy tale come true. _EOL_ I am trying to get you to see what an idiot Ian is. _EOL_ Yeah well. _EOL_ Like I need to- _EOL_ Hang on. I'm really sorry. _EOL_ Why not, I love watching overweight tourists throw up after they've been on one ride too many. _EOL_ Depends, are you auditioning for the Joker? _EOL_ Well, you look constipated. _EOL_ You never know, Ian, few years you might not be a guest. Might be picking up an honour yourself. _EOL_ Jane... _EOL_ We're thinking of looking into some new premises in the summer, aren't we? _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Blimey. I thought we were the Addams family round here. _EOL_ Right, I'd like to propose a toast. To Ian, Jane and the Queen. We might all take the rise out of it but it's really an amazing thing to be doing. So. Ian, Jane and the Queen! _EOL_ What have you got there then? _EOL_ Let's have a look. ‚Ian's punk tape'. I had you down as a T'Pau man. _EOL_ Ian. This piece has got ‚Buckingham' printed on it. _EOL_ I'll phone Edward. _EOL_ We phoned Edward. _EOL_ ‚God save the queen. Her fascist regime. They made you a moron - ‚ _EOL_ But surely, you giving Lucy that tape means, sub-consciously, you endorse all of its sentiments? _EOL_ I think it means there's no future in us having a royal family. _EOL_ Wasn't that the navy? _EOL_ And paid for by the rest of us. _EOL_ He does realize he's only watching the ceremony? It's Edward's award, Ian, not yours. _EOL_ And if you keep your teeth clenched it all comes out your nose. Steven, come on. Lucy, get your coat. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ Lucy, I can't leave you here on your own, darling. _EOL_ Okay, what's going on? What _EOL_ I'm going to let you get away with it - whatever it is. Just behave yourselves, alright? Come on you. _EOL_ Well let's split up, meet at the park in a few hours, and see how we're doing. _EOL_ Nobody's seen her at the canal. _EOL_ \",\n",
       " 'CLARE': \"Dot? Dot! _EOL_ Where's Dot? _EOL_ Do people still use this place? _EOL_ And what about Pauline? _EOL_ Something like that. _EOL_ I didn't. _EOL_ I'm waiting for someone. _EOL_ The fella that runs this place. Does he still live round here? _EOL_ Bit of a comedown from the one I remember. _EOL_ Bacon sandwich. Please. _EOL_ Not really. _EOL_ Listen...er... _EOL_ I don't suppose you could lend me some cash can ya? Just to get me out of here. _EOL_ Pauline... _EOL_ Come on, Ian. You chucked me and Sonia out the cafe enough times. _EOL_ Not so little. _EOL_ I tried to call for Dot, but she wasn't there. My boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend. _EOL_ All I need is somewhere to clean myself up and then I'm out of here. Please, Ian. I've got nowhere else to go... _EOL_ I mean it... As soon as I've got the cash, I'm on the next train out of here... _EOL_ Look I've gotta go...Sorry I hope you don't mind... _EOL_ Are you alright, Ian? _EOL_ It's just you seem a bit flustered. Is this Pauline's old stuff? _EOL_ That's just as well in this... ... A bit dull isn't it? Right... _EOL_ Look Ian, I really appreciate this. _EOL_ You'll have to le me repay the favour one day. _EOL_ Bates. And we've already met. _EOL_ I needed somewhere to slip out of my clothes... and Ian kindly stepped in. _EOL_ Well he said you never wore it. _EOL_ Well, it's a little bit loose, but it's nothing a belt won't sort... _EOL_ I might just do that. _EOL_ I really ought to be going. _EOL_ Trust me Jane. I'm doing you a favour here. _EOL_ I can get one myself. _EOL_ No no no. I don't need any handouts, Ian. _EOL_ Look, I've gotta be somewhere... _EOL_ Hello, Dot. _EOL_ It's so great to see you. _EOL_ ... Dot, I've really gotta be going. _EOL_ I'll tell you what. Next time I'm in Walford... I'll comes and stay for a _EOL_ That Ian's doing alright, hasn't he? For someone that owns a poxy cafe. _EOL_ Do you know what? _EOL_ I'm not in a rush to be anywhere. _EOL_ You're the closest thing I've got to family Dot. I'd do anything for you. _EOL_ You've done enough. _EOL_ Thanks Dot but I really should be moving on. I've got _EOL_ The trouble is...I'm a bit short on cash.. _EOL_ Really.... _EOL_ Alright, I will. _EOL_ Just thought I'd return this. _EOL_ Not exactly my style. _EOL_ Fine thanks. She's been really kind. _EOL_ That kind of depends on you. _EOL_ If I'm gonna stay around, I need some work. So I was wondering.... _EOL_ You know what? I don't think it's really me do you? I'm used to working in a more sophisticated environment. _EOL_ How dare you! _EOL_ I tried really hard. I don't think Jane likes me very much. Think maybe it's best if I move on after all. _EOL_ Tanya? _EOL_ Sorry about that madam. _EOL_ Yes. Loads of times. _EOL_ It might stink a little bit. _EOL_ Just forgot my scarf. _EOL_ D'you want me to get that for you? _EOL_ I've done reception work before. _EOL_ Good afternoon Booty. Yep, just one moment Mrs Finlay. I'll just check for you. Mrs George? If you'd like to take a seat someone will be with you shortly. Sorry to keep you waiting. We can offer you 11.30 or 2.30. Whichever's better for you. That's fine. Ok, that's in the diary. Any problems, give us a call. Look forward to seeing you then. _EOL_ Nice uniform. _EOL_ Looking forward to your first day? _EOL_ Just trying to be friendly. _EOL_ Morning Tanya. Where shall I put my coat? _EOL_ See you then, bye. Gaynor needs someone to sweep up. And I'll have a coffee please. Milk. No sugar. _EOL_ And I say you do. _EOL_ Tanya doesn't pay you to sit around on your... _EOL_ Fine. I will. But I'll be having a word with Tanya about your aggressive attitude. _EOL_ Was it definitely 12 o' clock? I'm really sorry about this... there seems to be some kind of mix up...Excuse me a moment... I've got a regular claiming I booked her in with Gaynor this morning and that I offered all of her friends a 50% discount. Do you know anything about it? _EOL_ Look, Tanya's gonna be back in a minute. I need you to stay here and help me sort out this mess. _EOL_ You don't wanna make an enemy out of me Chelsea. _EOL_ I'm prepared to start again if you are. _EOL_ Look, neither of us are gonna last very long if we can't we be friends. _EOL_ OK. If that's what it takes. _EOL_ Simple. I put them there. Planned the whole thing. _EOL_ because I wanted to show you who's boss. To prevent any further ‚misunderstandings'. _EOL_ Be my guest. But who do you think she's gonna believe? Me? Or some lying ex con she never wanted back in the first place. You better start behaving yourself Chelsea. _EOL_ Cos now you know I can break you any time I want. _EOL_ We.ll be alright. Say bye bye Mummy. _EOL_ Take your time, go shopping, treat yourself. _EOL_ You're gonna get a raise, you carry on like this. Bye bye darling. _EOL_ Thanks. _EOL_ Here we are. _EOL_ Hello? _EOL_ Stick a dryer in the sink, did you? _EOL_ Blow the fuses on purpose? Try and get me into trouble? _EOL_ Tanya is not your concern. The only person you need to worry about, is me. _EOL_ Tanya will fire me if I don't get him back soon. Do you mind? Please? _EOL_ You look sorry. _EOL_ Is that how you apologized to Stacey? Dot told me. That was mean of me. It's none of my business. _EOL_ Well, you can't help who you're attracted to, can you? And for what it's worth, if I had of known I'd have let you take him anyway. _EOL_ It's the kids that suffer when parents split, it's not fair to use them as weapons. You had an affair, it's just sex, isn't it? It's not like anyone died. I tell you what, if I got married I'd be awful - so unfaithful. Just as well I'm single, eh? I'll see myself out. _EOL_ Yeah it's here. _EOL_ It had just fallen off the side of the sofa. _EOL_ Yes, I'm the same - always forgetting where I put things. Oh, before I forget, here. _EOL_ Oh thanks Dot, I really appreciate it. I was saving it to go to that club tonight, meet some new friends. R & R? _EOL_ Ah, that would be great. I've seen him around. He looks lovely. _EOL_ I know we've already met. Clare. _EOL_ Oh, sorry about that. _EOL_ Who doesn't? _EOL_ Absolutely. _EOL_ Thank you for talking to Jack and setting this up. _EOL_ He's come to collect me? Oh Dot. You're the best, thank you. _EOL_ Thanks. _EOL_ That's actually Jack's job. _EOL_ You will be back though yeah? _EOL_ I wonder if Jack's out of his office yet? _EOL_ Well I hate poetry. I think it's really boring. _EOL_ Well I'm not everyone. _EOL_ I haven't been great company, have I? _EOL_ Yeah, I was. Gus, look I'm sorry. It's just...I'm just getting over someone, a bit wounded, that's all. _EOL_ Gus? I'm ready now. Thank _EOL_ Ooh! You startled me. Hi. You must be Bradley. I've heard all about you. Clare... _EOL_ So you've already seen her again this morning? _EOL_ From everything Dot's told me, she sounds a really nasty piece of work. _EOL_ The awful truth is, Bradley, some women are just out for themselves. _EOL_ But you'd never know cos they come across all sweetness and light. And they're the worst. _EOL_ Listen - I've been hurt too. I know what it's like. You must be really angry with your Dad. What on earth did Stacey ever see in him? _EOL_ No. I suppose he must be quite well off? _EOL_ It's sad, but some women do fall for that. Excuse me. _EOL_ Professional attitude at all times. _EOL_ Chelsea... _EOL_ I think you and me have got off on the wrong foot. _EOL_ So it's Gaynor's day off and with Tanya off too we're gonna be spending a lot of time together. So let's try and get on, yeah? _EOL_ Hi. _EOL_ I'm a bit embarrassed to say. It's Clare Bates. Your wife's salon? _EOL_ Well i'ts me that's been sending you the texts. _EOL_ yeah I didn't mean to play games, though I can understand why it might have come across like that. _EOL_ It's here in the book here. Sorry if I offended you. _EOL_ I'm thinking of making some investments. I hear you offer the best endowment in the business. _EOL_ You still there? _EOL_ If you're passing thesalon, maybe you could pop in sometime and we could have a chat about it. And if you're worried about running into your wife, she's taking the day off. _EOL_ What on earth are you listening to? _EOL_ Bradley. Making yourself miserable isn't gonna help. _EOL_ You're taking this all way too seriously. _EOL_ Who says I haven't been through what you're going through? Only I realised sitting around moping was never gonna get me anywhere. Who's Stacey's best mate? _EOL_ Assuming she's not a complete dog, that's where I'd be looking. Make you feel a whole lot better. _EOL_ Look - I gotta turn this off - it's doing my head in. _EOL_ You'll never guess what I did today. _EOL_ Gave a massage. Never done one before in my life. He never guessed. Loved it. Even gave me a tip. You might know him. Ian Beale. _EOL_ No reason. _EOL_ So? You weren't seriously suggesting... _EOL_ Regardless of whether he's married, the guy's a total creep. Must be about ninety. I'm gonna make myself a cup of tea - you want one? _EOL_ Bradley, if you play that record one more time, I'm gonna break it over your head. Thank you. _EOL_ You two look busy. _EOL_ Just seen your Uncle Jack coming out the flat. He doesn't look very happy. _EOL_ Think it's possible your Dad might have had stuff stolen too? _EOL_ Maybe it would serve him right. _EOL_ For hurting Bradley. _EOL_ That's just weird. The whole point of an enemy is that you don't like them. _EOL_ I can go and ask if you like. _EOL_ It's only over the road and I'd like to do my bit. Like you said ‚Give out love, get love back'? _EOL_ I'll be as quick as I can. _EOL_ Oh well. Never mind. Thanks for looking. How's the shoulder? The massage? Yesterday? _EOL_ You've got a great physique for a man of your age. _EOL_ Ian. _EOL_ Tell me if I'm interfering, but I used to do silver service. Up in Scotland. _EOL_ If you needed to brush up, I could help you if you like. _EOL_ Maybe you could come round to Dot's one night. You could cook something and I could show you how to serveit. _EOL_ If it's gonna help. When are you free? _EOL_ Tomorrow night it is then. _EOL_ Alright - I'll do that. If I don't see you before, I'll see you Tomorrow. _EOL_ Perfect. _EOL_ I know these aren't exactly the right type, but Marie seemed to think they'd do. _EOL_ It's no trouble. Dot...are you gonna be in tomorrow night? _EOL_ I was thinking I might _EOL_ Bye now. _EOL_ Strikes me that with Tanya off again today - no Gaynor - and nothing in the book till after lunch, that ‚open' sign is just making work for ourselves. _EOL_ I'll just tell her Nigel had a heart attack or something. _EOL_ Don't act all shocked. I know all about what you and your step-brother did to Sean Slater. _EOL_ Look, I'm not judging you. If anything, I'm impressed, the more I hear. _EOL_ Why fight each other when we can help each other out? _EOL_ You do something for me, I'll do something for you. That could work out to be a mutually beneficial arrangement. What do you say? _EOL_ Cooee! _EOL_ Ooh! _EOL_ Jim'll love a jar of that. _EOL_ Just wanted to check that you were okay. I worry about you. _EOL_ I'll get it. Hello? _EOL_ Really? When? _EOL_ Go on. _EOL_ Right, I'll pass it on. _EOL_ Now they said specifically that you weren't to worry. _EOL_ Jim's nursing home. He's been asking after you. _EOL_ They asked that you DIDN'T do that, actually. _EOL_ Because all this coming and going what's disturbing him. One day you're there, the next minute you're not. _EOL_ Listen - I've just had a thought. Tell me if you think it's stupid. _EOL_ Why don't you go and spend some time with Carol? Then you can be close by to be on hand whenever Jim needed you. _EOL_ Dot,Dot, you do too much. Carol won't mind, it's only gonna be for a couple of days. i'll look after the launderette and Bradley. Jim needs you now. _EOL_ Bradley about? _EOL_ Bradley? _EOL_ Look, this is a really difficult thing to say because I know Dot wouldn't ask herself. _EOL_ She's got this idea in her head that she's gonna go and stay at Carol's so she can visit Jim more often. Only I know for a fact that she's really worried about going on her own. _EOL_ I'm gonna miss you so much. _EOL_ Make sure you look after her. She's a very special lady, aren't you, Dot? _EOL_ I'll be fine. If I get lonely, i'll call Nigel. _EOL_ It's no big deal. Just wanted the place to myself. A girl needs to have fun. _EOL_ For the same reason I wouldn't quite believe you if you said the same thing to me. _EOL_ All in good time. Meanwhile, I owe you one. Two white wines and soda, please, Ronnie. _EOL_ Hiya. _EOL_ I just wondered what you were cooking tonight so I lknow what wine to get. _EOL_ Yeah, we'll be fine. Big do is it? _EOL_ Why not. _EOL_ Customer's waiting. _EOL_ I er, left it too late to get my service-wash back. It was either this or one of Dot's anoraks. _EOL_ What? _EOL_ No. You've gone to the trouble of getting the food. Besides, it's not like you've seen me with my clothes off before. At least I'm in more than a towel this time. It doesn't make you uncomfortable? _EOL_ Right then. Get ‚em off. _EOL_ If I'm going to stand here half naked, then you need to strip too. _EOL_ I was only joking! What do you take me for? _EOL_ I just wanted to apologise for yesterday. I don't know about you but I really thought we were getting somewhere. I was hoping you could let me make it up to you. _EOL_ Don't be silly. And this time there'll be no interruptions. _EOL_ Well, if a job's worth doing it's worth doing well. I learnt that by watching you. But don't tell Dot that I've used her best silver. Now, you have to remember your diner is the most important person in the world. It's your duty to make their experience as pleasurable as possible. _EOL_ I admire you, you know that? _EOL_ Oh, I respect a man who puts his kids first. _EOL_ I mean, I remember Cindy; she was so glamorous and sexy. _EOL_ So, it sort of surprised me when I found out you were married to... well, the woman from the cafe. Don't get me wrong, I think it's great. You know, your kids needed a Mum, so you bagged a real mumsie type. Jane's so hard working. I wish I could be more like that. _EOL_ She never seems to find a moment for herself? Pluck those eyebrows... shave those legs. Not like me, I'm so vain! My legs are always silky smooth, no matter what. We've all got our crosses to bear! _EOL_ Think nothing of it. _EOL_ Certainly not, it was my pleasure. _EOL_ I'm sure you'll think of something. _EOL_ Just going to the laundrette. My smalls. _EOL_ You know bras, knickers, teddies. Got loads. Well, one load, actually. _EOL_ Well I was thinking. The silver service. If you wanted any more lessons... _EOL_ I know a few tricks. Maybe I could show you them. _EOL_ Okay. Perhaps another time. _EOL_ Just waiting for my washing to finish. You know, my -- _EOL_ I should probably handwash them really. I wouldn't want the suspenders getting caught and stretching. They wouldn't hold up the stockings now, would they? Lose their snap. Suspenders need a bit of snap, don't they? _EOL_ Someone's been working hard. Years ago, I thought all blokes had to be really buff. You know six-packs. Muscles. Been out with a few. Now I know that's not what's important. _EOL_ It's up here that counts. _EOL_ The mind. That's what turns me on. _EOL_ It's obvious, really. Could've saved myself a lot of trouble. What did I know? I was a kid. _EOL_ In all the right places. _EOL_ I like hotels. They've got rooms. _EOL_ Sorry. I just thought ﬁthe early bird catches the wormﬂ... _EOL_ Yeah, no problem. I would've come after work, only I'm being taken out to dinner. Can't wait! _EOL_ Hello sir. Have you come about the appointment? _EOL_ Looks like somebody needs some TLC. Would you like to go up? _EOL_ Let's see if we can fit you in? _EOL_ What time's dinner? _EOL_ Oh. And there's me thinking you were gonna take me away from all this. _EOL_ I know. You never seem to get a break. There's me thinking I've got it hard. _EOL_ Oh well, it's only dinner... can't miss what you've never had, can you? _EOL_ Box of assorted pastries, please. _EOL_ Oh! Hiya. Didn't expect to see you here. I thought you'd be up to your eyes in your event. _EOL_ I thought there was a huge cock-up with the venue. I heard Jane talking about it earlier... _EOL_ I suppose when a man gets to your position he has to delegate. _EOL_ Must be hard, though. Making all the big decisions, having to approve everything they come up with... _EOL_ Well, if you need any help, just ask... _EOL_ We don't usually make house calls... but for you, I made an exception. _EOL_ Looks cosy. Quiet? _EOL_ So, no Jane? _EOL_ Ahh, you're so sweet. Wish I had a boss like you. So... would you like me to show you my Bird of Paradise? Or I suppose we should wait for Jane? _EOL_ Oh. _EOL_ Not going to get me too giddy. I've got work in the morning. _EOL_ Oh, are you still stiff? You shouldn't overdo it... with _EOL_ You know your problem? _EOL_ Too driven. Maybe you should have another massage. Full-body... _EOL_ It's not good for you, all that pressure, building up. Every now and then you gotta let off some steam otherwise, you'll explode. _EOL_ He must have had a bad dream. I could read to him is you like..? _EOL_ Sorry, I hope you don't mind, do you? Just getting myself relaxed. Must be this wine, it's so nice. _EOL_ Mm. Well I said I didn't wanna get too giddy, but. Could always resist everything except but temptation. _EOL_ Whoa! See the way I look at it... ... all the men I've known have been too young for me. _EOL_ No! Older guys know what they want. Like me. I know what I want, and I won't stop until I get it. My last boyfriend said I was a succubus. _EOL_ Like a demon, has her wicked way with blokes... sucks all the energy out of them. _EOL_ I don't know. I probably just haven't kissed the right frog... So, when are we gonna get my magic fingers working? Your massage? Don't tell me you've shy on me now? It's not like I haven't seen it before. Well, nearly all of it... _EOL_ Oh... _EOL_ I'd better go upstairs and get myself cleaned up... There you go. It's not like we haven't been here before, is it? Hope you've got some bigger towels. _EOL_ I hope you don't mind, I borrowed one of your shirts... Oh... so, this is what you want? _EOL_ Do what? Look, you obviously wanna get comfortable, I think I'd better go... _EOL_ Why would I want that! Look I just meant for you to book an appointment. No harm done though... _EOL_ Ahh, just what I need. Must make a few quid, this place? _EOL_ When you gonna get a grip? _EOL_ You need to get out the house, Bradley. Get a job. _EOL_ because you're floating around here like the ghost of Christmas Past. And you smell. _EOL_ Oh. Thanks. _EOL_ I won't quite be able to look at you in the same way again. _EOL_ I haven't washed it. _EOL_ It's no trouble. _EOL_ What d'you think I'm gonna do - keep it and use it as evidence? _EOL_ Yeah. As ice. _EOL_ I didn't know who to go to. I am really worried about him. He's not eating properly, sleeping. Half the time, he won't even get off the sofa. _EOL_ Anyone'd think it was the flamin' Oscars. _EOL_ Still? I mean, are you? Right, I'm done. So... _EOL_ Well that's what it's all about, Ian. Loyalty, to friends, Queen, country. _EOL_ Ian. No Jane today. _EOL_ Don't you trust me? _EOL_ Mine's a red wine please Ian. _EOL_ Don't stop on my account. Bradley, that kitchen - even the mice are complaining! And in here, it stinks! _EOL_ But you couldn't find a window in your busy schedule, right? _EOL_ James Bond trivia? _EOL_ No thanks. Some of us have got a better way to spend our time. _EOL_ So you found them then? _EOL_ You should have told them it's a joke. After all, that's all it is, isn't it? _EOL_ Ironing a shirt to sign on, it's a bit much isn't it? _EOL_ A building site? _EOL_ Oh well, at least you don't have to look smart to get a labourer's job. _EOL_ Nothing, I just didn't know the burnt look was in fashion that's all. _EOL_ I'm learning more and more about you everyday. _EOL_ Go in your vest. Very Village People. _EOL_ Er, yeah, _EOL_ I'm sorry I didn't mean to drop you in it. _EOL_ She almost knocked me over as she charged out your gate. She was well fired up. _EOL_ That's the trouble isn't it. They tell you one thing and who knows what they're getting up to. _EOL_ So how did the big interview go? _EOL_ Ah, so you didn't get it. No point tapping you for a drink then. _EOL_ Loser. _EOL_ I wish you wouldn't keep dialing those premium rate numbers. _EOL_ So you're going to get to wear a hard hat, don't get too excited. _EOL_ Well, that's great news. Well done you, you really deserve it. _EOL_ Sorry I'm late. Dot's back. _EOL_ I know it's cheeky but is it alright if I take an early lunch. Pop back and make a fuss of her. _EOL_ Jim okay is he? _EOL_ Perhaps I could come with you one time. I'd love to meet him. _EOL_ I bet he's pleased for Bradley, getting this new job. _EOL_ I was thinking, perhaps we could go the Vic later for a few drinks, celebrate. _EOL_ It would be nice to make something of it, poor Bradley's been through enough recently hasn't he. _EOL_ Getting this job, it's a chance for him to move on. Put things behind him. _EOL_ I can go. It's not a problem. _EOL_ I can go on my way. Look, you've had a long journey. It's no trouble. _EOL_ It's the least I can do. _EOL_ Yeah, a fresh start. _EOL_ There you go. You get a seat and I'll get the drinks. _EOL_ He's on his way. PHil. Did you get my message about a few people coming in to celebrate Bradley's job. _EOL_ And? _EOL_ Any chance of some free bubbles? Get everyone one in the mood. _EOL_ Well look Tracey's my Godmother, it's her job to make my dreams come true. Go on, just a couple of bottles for luck. Pretty please. _EOL_ Thanks. _EOL_ Yeah it is. _EOL_ I'm so glad you're back. _EOL_ No it's fine. _EOL_ It was just an accident, it'll wash out. Bradley looks like he's having a good time. _EOL_ Oh he's such a lovely guy, I really hope this job works out for him. He deserves it. _EOL_ Of course not, he's a lovely guy but... No, I dunno... _EOL_ He's had such a horrible time. I wouldn't... Stop it. _EOL_ Don't you say anything to him ok. _EOL_ Or how about a Porsche. I could just imagine myself cruising up the Kings Road, top down. _EOL_ So are you thirty six or forty six? _EOL_ Are you thirty six or forty six? D'you fancy a dance? _EOL_ A dance, come on let's have a dance? _EOL_ Can you wait here a minute? _EOL_ I'll be back. Stay right there. _EOL_ There's so many creeps in this place. Will you just stand by me or soemthing, pretend to be my boyfriend? _EOL_ Hey, I could so pull you. _EOL_ Look I'm joking. And what's a normal couple anyway? _EOL_ Exactly. Hey look can you put your arm round me. _EOL_ Put your arm round me. Quick. _EOL_ Bradley ... You've got to move on, you know that? _EOL_ Look, it'll be ok. You can do it. Come on. Let's go home yeah? _EOL_ \"}"
